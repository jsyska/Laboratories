NOSTROMOA TALE OF THE SEABOARDBYJOSEPH CONRAD"So foul a sky clears not without a storm."                        - SHAKESPEARETOJOHN GALSWORTHYAUTHOR'S NOTE"NOSTROMO" is the most anxiously meditated of the longer novelswhich belong to the period following upon the publication of the"Typhoon" volume of short stories.I don't mean to say that I became then conscious of any impendingchange in my mentality and in my attitude towards the tasks of mywriting life. And perhaps there was never any change, except inthat mysterious, extraneous thing which has nothing to do withthe theories of art; a subtle change in the nature of theinspiration; a phenomenon for which I can not in any way be heldresponsible. What, however, did cause me some concern was thatafter finishing the last story of the "Typhoon" volume it seemedsomehow that there was nothing more in the world to write about.This so strangely negative but disturbing mood lasted some littletime; and then, as with many of my longer stories, the first hintfor "Nostromo" came to me in the shape of a vagrant anecdotecompletely destitute of valuable details.As a matter of fact in 1875 or '6, when very young, in the WestIndies or rather in the Gulf of Mexico, for my contacts with landwere short, few, and fleeting, I heard the story of some man whowas supposed to have stolen single-handed a whole lighter-full ofsilver, somewhere on the Tierra Firme seaboard during thetroubles of a revolution.On the face of it this was something of a feat. But I heard nodetails, and having no particular interest in crime qua crime Iwas not likely to keep that one in my mind. And I forgot it tilltwenty-six or seven years afterwards I came upon the very thingin a shabby volume picked up outside a second-hand book-shop. Itwas the life story of an American seaman written by himself withthe assistance of a journalist. In the course of his wanderingsthat American sailor worked for some months on board a schooner,the master and owner of which was the thief of whom I had heardin my very young days. I have no doubt of that because therecould hardly have been two exploits of that peculiar kind in thesame part of the world and both connected with a South Americanrevolution.The fellow had actually managed to steal a lighter with silver,and this, it seems, only because he was implicitly trusted by hisemployers, who must have been singularly poor judges ofcharacter. In the sailor's story he is represented as anunmitigated rascal, a small cheat, stupidly ferocious, morose, ofmean appearance, and altogether unworthy of the greatness thisopportunity had thrust upon him. What was interesting was that hewould boast of it openly.He used to say: "People think I make a lot of money in thisschooner of mine. But that is nothing.  I don't care for that.Now and then I go away quietly and lift a bar of silver. I mustget rich slowly--you understand."There was also another curious point about the man.  Once in thecourse of some quarrel the sailor threatened him: "What's toprevent me reporting ashore what you have told me about thatsilver?"The cynical ruffian was not alarmed in the least. He actuallylaughed. "You fool, if you dare talk like that on shore about meyou will get a knife stuck in your back. Every man, woman, andchild in that port is my friend. And who's to prove the lighterwasn't sunk? I didn't show you where the silver is hidden.  DidI? So you know nothing. And suppose I lied? Eh?"Ultimately the sailor, disgusted with the sordid meanness of thatimpenitent thief, deserted from the schooner.  The whole episodetakes about three pages of his autobiography. Nothing to speakof; but as I looked them over, the curious confirmation of thefew casual words heard in my early youth evoked the memories ofthat distant time when everything was so fresh, so surprising, soventuresome, so interesting; bits of strange coasts under thestars, shadows of hills in the sunshine, men's passions in thedusk, gossip half-forgotten, faces grown dim. . . . Perhaps,perhaps, there still was in the world something to write about.Yet I did not see anything at first in the mere story. A rascalsteals a large parcel of a valuable commodity--so people say.It's either true or untrue; and in any case it has no value initself. To invent a circumstantial account of the robbery did notappeal to me, because my talents not running that way I did notthink that the game was worth the candle. It was only when itdawned upon me that the purloiner of the treasure need notnecessarily be a confirmed rogue, that he could be even a man ofcharacter, an actor and possibly a victim in the changing scenesof a revolution, it was only then that I had the first vision ofa twilight country which was to become the province of Sulaco,with its high shadowy Sierra and its misty Campo for mutewitnesses of events flowing from the passions of menshort-sighted in good and evil.Such are in very truth the obscure origins of "Nostromo"--thebook. From that moment, I suppose, it had to be. Yet even then Ihesitated, as if warned by the instinct of self-preservation fromventuring on a distant and toilsome journey into a land full ofintrigues and revolutions. But it had to be done.It took the best part of the years 1903-4 to do; with manyintervals of renewed hesitation, lest I should lose myself in theever-enlarging vistas opening before me as I progressed deeper inmy knowledge of the country.  Often, also, when I had thoughtmyself to a standstill over the tangled-up affairs of theRepublic, I would, figuratively speaking, pack my bag, rush awayfrom Sulaco for a change of air and write a few pages of the"Mirror of the Sea." But generally, as I've said before, mysojourn on the Continent of Latin America, famed for itshospitality, lasted for about two years.  On my return I found(speaking somewhat in the style of Captain Gulliver) my familyall well, my wife heartily glad to learn that the fuss was allover, and our small boy considerably grown during my absence.My principal authority for the history of Costaguana is, ofcourse, my venerated friend, the late Don Jose Avellanos,Minister to the Courts of England and Spain, etc., etc., in hisimpartial and eloquent "History of Fifty Years of Misrule." Thatwork was never published--the reader will discover why--and I amin fact the only person in the world possessed of its contents. Ihave mastered them in not a few hours of earnest meditation, andI hope that my accuracy will be trusted. In justice to myself,and to allay the fears of prospective readers, I beg to point outthat the few historical allusions are never dragged in for thesake of parading my unique erudition, but that each of them isclosely related to actuality; either throwing a light on thenature of current events or affecting directly the fortunes ofthe people of whom I speak.As to their own histories I have tried to set them down,Aristocracy and People, men and women, Latin and Anglo-Saxon,bandit and politician, with as cool a hand as was possible in theheat and clash of my own conflicting emotions. And after all thisis also the story of their conflicts. It is for the reader to sayhow far they are deserving of interest in their actions and inthe secret purposes of their hearts revealed in the bitternecessities of the time. I confess that, for me, that time is thetime of firm friendships and unforgotten hospitalities. And in mygratitude I must mention here Mrs. Gould, "the first lady ofSulaco," whom we may safely leave to the secret devotion of Dr.Monygham, and Charles Gould, the Idealist-creator of MaterialInterests whom we must leave to his Mine--from which there is noescape in this world.About Nostromo, the second of the two racially and sociallycontrasted men, both captured by the silver of the San Tome Mine,I feel bound to say something more.I did not hesitate to make that central figure an Italian.  Firstof all the thing is perfectly credible: Italians were swarminginto the Occidental Province at the time, as anybody who willread further can see; and secondly, there was no one who couldstand so well by the side of Giorgio Viola the Garibaldino, theIdealist of the old, humanitarian revolutions. For myself Ineeded there a Man of the People as free as possible from hisclass-conventions and all settled modes of thinking. This is nota side snarl at conventions. My reasons were not moral butartistic. Had he been an Anglo-Saxon he would have tried to getinto local politics.  But Nostromo does not aspire to be a leaderin a personal game. He does not want to raise himself above themass. He is content to feel himself a power--within the People.But mainly Nostromo is what he is because I received theinspiration for him in my early days from a Mediterranean sailor.Those who have read certain pages of mine will see at once what Imean when I say that Dominic, the padrone of the Tremolino, mightunder given circumstances have been a Nostromo. At any rateDominic would have understood the younger man perfectly--ifscornfully. He and I were engaged together in a rather absurdadventure, but the absurdity does not matter. It is a realsatisfaction to think that in my very young days there must,after all, have been something in me worthy to command that man'shalf-bitter fidelity, his half-ironic devotion. Many ofNostromo's speeches I have heard first in Dominic's voice.  Hishand on the tiller and his fearless eyes roaming the horizon fromwithin the monkish hood shadowing his face, he would utter theusual exordium of his remorseless wisdom: "Vous autresgentilhommes!" in a caustic tone that hangs on my ear yet. LikeNostromo!  "You hombres finos!" Very much like Nostromo.  ButDominic the Corsican nursed a certain pride of ancestry fromwhich my Nostromo is free; for Nostromo's lineage had to be moreancient still. He is a man with the weight of countlessgenerations behind him and no parentage to boast of. . . . Likethe People.In his firm grip on the earth he inherits, in his improvidenceand generosity, in his lavishness with his gifts, in his manlyvanity, in the obscure sense of his greatness and in his faithfuldevotion with something despairing as well as desperate in itsimpulses, he is a Man of the People, their very own unenviousforce, disdaining to lead but ruling from within. Yearsafterwards, grown older as the famous Captain Fidanza, with astake in the country, going about his many affairs followed byrespectful glances in the modernized streets of Sulaco, callingon the widow of the cargador, attending the Lodge, listening inunmoved silence to anarchist speeches at the meeting, theenigmatical patron of the new revolutionary agitation, thetrusted, the wealthy comrade Fidanza with the knowledge of hismoral ruin locked up in his breast, he remains essentially a Manof the People. In his mingled love and scorn of life and in thebewildered conviction of having been betrayed, of dying betrayedhe hardly knows by what or by whom, he is still of the People,their undoubted Great Man--with a private history of his own.One more figure of those stirring times I would like to mention:and that is Antonia Avellanos--the "beautiful Antonia." Whethershe is a possible variation of Latin-American girlhood I wouldn'tdare to affirm. But, for me, she is. Always a little in thebackground by the side of her father (my venerated friend) I hopeshe has yet relief enough to make intelligible what I am going tosay. Of all the people who had seen with me the birth of theOccidental Republic, she is the only one who has kept in mymemory the aspect of continued life. Antonia the Aristocrat andNostromo the Man of the People are the artisans of the New Era,the true creators of the New State; he by his legendary anddaring feat, she, like a woman, simply by the force of what sheis: the only being capable of inspiring a sincere passion in theheart of a trifler.If anything could induce me to revisit Sulaco (I should hate tosee all these changes) it would be Antonia.  And the true reasonfor that--why not be frank about it?--the true reason is that Ihave modelled her on my first love. How we, a band of tallishschoolboys, the chums of her two brothers, how we used to look upto that girl just out of the schoolroom herself, as thestandard-bearer of a faith to which we all were born but whichshe alone knew how to hold aloft with an unflinching hope! Shehad perhaps more glow and less serenity in her soul than Antonia,but she was an uncompromising Puritan of patriotism with no taintof the slightest worldliness in her thoughts. I was not the onlyone in love with her; but it was I who had to hear oftenest herscathing criticism of my levities--very much like poor Decoud--orstand the brunt of her austere, unanswerable invective. She didnot quite understand--but never mind. That afternoon when I camein, a shrinking yet defiant sinner, to say the final good-bye Ireceived a hand-squeeze that made my heart leap and saw a tearthat took my breath away. She was softened at the last as thoughshe had suddenly perceived (we were such children still!) that Iwas really going away for good, going very far away--even as faras Sulaco, lying unknown, hidden from our eyes in the darkness ofthe Placid Gulf.That's why I long sometimes for another glimpse of the "beautifulAntonia" (or can it be the Other?) moving in the dimness of thegreat cathedral, saying a short prayer at the tomb of the firstand last Cardinal-Archbishop of Sulaco, standing absorbed infilial devotion before the monument of Don Jose Avellanos, and,with a lingering, tender, faithful glance at themedallion-memorial to Martin Decoud, going out serenely into thesunshine of the Plaza with her upright carriage and her whitehead; a relic of the past disregarded by men awaiting impatientlythe Dawns of other New Eras, the coming of more Revolutions.But this is the idlest of dreams; for I did understand perfectlywell at the time that the moment the breath left the body of theMagnificent Capataz, the Man of the People, freed at last fromthe toils of love and wealth, there was nothing more for me to doin Sulaco.J. C.October, 1917.CONTENTSPART FIRSTTHE SILVER OF THE MINEPART SECONDTHE ISABELSPART THIRDTHE LIGHTHOUSENOSTROMOCHAPTER ONEIN THE time of Spanish rule, and for many years afterwards, thetown of Sulaco--the luxuriant beauty of the orange gardens bearswitness to its antiquity--had never been commercially anythingmore important than a coasting port with a fairly large localtrade in ox-hides and indigo. The clumsy deep-sea galleons of theconquerors that, needing a brisk gale to move at all, would liebecalmed, where your modern ship built on clipper lines forgesahead by the mere flapping of her sails, had been barred out ofSulaco by the prevailing calms of its vast gulf. Some harbours ofthe earth are made difficult of access by the treachery of sunkenrocks and the tempests of their shores. Sulaco had found aninviolable sanctuary from the temptations of a trading world inthe solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if within anenormous semi-circular and unroofed temple open to the ocean,with its walls of lofty mountains hung with the mourningdraperies of cloud.On one side of this broad curve in the straight seaboard of theRepublic of Costaguana, the last spur of the coast range forms aninsignificant cape whose name is Punta Mala. From the middle ofthe gulf the point of the land itself is not visible at all; butthe shoulder of a steep hill at the back can be made out faintlylike a shadow on the sky.On the other side, what seems to be an isolated patch of bluemist floats lightly on the glare of the horizon.  This is thepeninsula of Azuera, a wild chaos of sharp rocks and stony levelscut about by vertical ravines. It lies far out to sea like arough head of stone stretched from a green-clad coast at the endof a slender neck of sand covered with thickets of thorny scrub.Utterly waterless, for the rainfall runs off at once on all sidesinto the sea, it has not soil enough--it is said--to grow asingle blade of grass, as if it were blighted by a curse.  Thepoor, associating by an obscure instinct of consolation the ideasof evil and wealth, will tell you that it is deadly because ofits forbidden treasures. The common folk of the neighbourhood,peons of the estancias, vaqueros of the seaboard plains, tameIndians coming miles to market with a bundle of sugar-cane or abasket of maize worth about threepence, are well aware that heapsof shining gold lie in the gloom of the deep precipices cleavingthe stony levels of Azuera.  Tradition has it that manyadventurers of olden time had perished in the search. The storygoes also that within men's memory two wandering sailors--Americanos, perhaps, but gringos of some sort for certain--talkedover a gambling, good-for-nothing mozo, and the three stole adonkey to carry for them a bundle of dry sticks, a water-skin,and provisions enough to last a few days.  Thus accompanied, andwith revolvers at their belts, they had started to chop their waywith machetes through the thorny scrub on the neck of thepeninsula.On the second evening an upright spiral of smoke (it could onlyhave been from their camp-fire) was seen for the first timewithin memory of man standing up faintly upon the sky above arazor-backed ridge on the stony head. The crew of a coastingschooner, lying becalmed three miles off the shore, stared at itwith amazement till dark. A negro fisherman, living in a lonelyhut in a little bay near by, had seen the start and was on thelookout for some sign. He called to his wife just as the sun wasabout to set. They had watched the strange portent with envy,incredulity, and awe.The impious adventurers gave no other sign. The sailors, theIndian, and the stolen burro were never seen again. As to themozo, a Sulaco man--his wife paid for some masses, and the poorfour-footed beast, being without sin, had been probably permittedto die; but the two gringos, spectral and alive, are believed tobe dwelling to this day amongst the rocks, under the fatal spellof their success. Their souls cannot tear themselves away fromtheir bodies mounting guard over the discovered treasure. Theyare now rich and hungry and thirsty--a strange theory oftenacious gringo ghosts suffering in their starved and parchedflesh of defiant heretics, where a Christian would have renouncedand been released.These, then, are the legendary inhabitants of Azuera guarding itsforbidden wealth; and the shadow on the sky on one side with theround patch of blue haze blurring the bright skirt of the horizonon the other, mark the two outermost points of the bend whichbears the name of Golfo Placido, because never a strong wind hadbeen known to blow upon its waters.On crossing the imaginary line drawn from Punta Mala to Azuerathe ships from Europe bound to Sulaco lose at once the strongbreezes of the ocean. They become the prey of capricious airsthat play with them for thirty hours at a stretch sometimes.Before them the head of the calm gulf is filled on most days ofthe year by a great body of motionless and opaque clouds. On therare clear mornings another shadow is cast upon the sweep of thegulf. The dawn breaks high behind the towering and serrated wallof the Cordillera, a clear-cut vision of dark peaks rearing theirsteep slopes on a lofty pedestal of forest rising from the veryedge of the shore.  Amongst them the white head of Higuerotarises majestically upon the blue. Bare clusters of enormous rockssprinkle with tiny black dots the smooth dome of snow.Then, as the midday sun withdraws from the gulf the shadow of themountains, the clouds begin to roll out of the lower valleys.They swathe in sombre tatters the naked crags of precipices abovethe wooded slopes, hide the peaks, smoke in stormy trails acrossthe snows of Higuerota. The Cordillera is gone from you as if ithad dissolved itself into great piles of grey and black vapoursthat travel out slowly to seaward and vanish into thin air allalong the front before the blazing heat of the day. The wastingedge of the cloud-bank always strives for, but seldom wins, themiddle of the gulf. The sun--as the sailors say--is eating it up.Unless perchance a sombre thunder-head breaks away from the mainbody to career all over the gulf till it escapes into the offingbeyond Azuera, where it bursts suddenly into flame and crasheslike a sinster pirate-ship of the air, hove-to above the horizon,engaging the sea.At night the body of clouds advancing higher up the sky smothersthe whole quiet gulf below with an impenetrable darkness, inwhich the sound of the falling showers can be heard beginning andceasing abruptly--now here, now there. Indeed, these cloudynights are proverbial with the seamen along the whole west coastof a great continent. Sky, land, and sea disappear together outof the world when the Placido--as the saying is--goes to sleepunder its black poncho. The few stars left below the seawardfrown of the vault shine feebly as into the mouth of a blackcavern. In its vastness your ship floats unseen under your feet,her sails flutter invisible above your head. The eye of GodHimself--they add with grim profanity--could not find out whatwork a man's hand is doing in there; and you would be free tocall the devil to your aid with impunity if even his malice werenot defeated by such a blind darkness.The shores on the gulf are steep-to all round; three uninhabitedislets basking in the sunshine just outside the cloud veil, andopposite the entrance to the harbour of Sulaco, bear the name of"The Isabels."There is the Great Isabel; the Little Isabel, which is round; andHermosa, which is the smallest.That last is no more than a foot high, and about seven pacesacross, a mere flat top of a grey rock which smokes like a hotcinder after a shower, and where no man would care to venture anaked sole before sunset. On the Little Isabel an old raggedpalm, with a thick bulging trunk rough with spines, a very witchamongst palm trees, rustles a dismal bunch of dead leaves abovethe coarse sand. The Great Isabel has a spring of fresh waterissuing from the overgrown side of a ravine.  Resembling anemerald green wedge of land a mile long, and laid flat upon thesea, it bears two forest trees standing close together, with awide spread of shade at the foot of their smooth trunks. A ravineextending the whole length of the island is full of bushes; andpresenting a deep tangled cleft on the high side spreads itselfout on the other into a shallow depression abutting on a smallstrip of sandy shore.From that low end of the Great Isabel the eye plunges through anopening two miles away, as abrupt as if chopped with an axe outof the regular sweep of the coast, right into the harbour ofSulaco. It is an oblong, lake-like piece of water. On one sidethe short wooded spurs and valleys of the Cordillera come down atright angles to the very strand; on the other the open view ofthe great Sulaco plain passes into the opal mystery of greatdistances overhung by dry haze. The town of Sulaco itself--topsof walls, a great cupola, gleams of white miradors in a vastgrove of orange trees--lies between the mountains and the plain,at some little distance from its harbour and out of the directline of sight from the sea.CHAPTER TWOTHE only sign of commercial activity within the harbour, visiblefrom the beach of the Great Isabel, is the square blunt end ofthe wooden jetty which the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company (theO.S.N. of familiar speech) had thrown over the shallow part ofthe bay soon after they had resolved to make of Sulaco one oftheir ports of call for the Republic of Costaguana.  The Statepossesses several harbours on its long seaboard, but exceptCayta, an important place, all are either small and inconvenientinlets in an iron-bound coast--like Esmeralda, for instance,sixty miles to the south--or else mere open roadsteads exposed tothe winds and fretted by the surf.Perhaps the very atmospheric conditions which had kept away themerchant fleets of bygone ages induced the O.S.N. Company toviolate the sanctuary of peace sheltering the calm existence ofSulaco. The variable airs sporting lightly with the vastsemicircle of waters within the head of Azuera could not bafflethe steam power of their excellent fleet. Year after year theblack hulls of their ships had gone up and down the coast, in andout, past Azuera, past the Isabels, past Punta Mala--disregardingeverything but the tyranny of time. Their names, the names of allmythology, became the household words of a coast that had neverbeen ruled by the gods of Olympus. The Juno was known only forher comfortable cabins amidships, the Saturn for the geniality ofher captain and the painted and gilt luxuriousness of her saloon,whereas the Ganymede was fitted out mainly for cattle transport,and to be avoided by coastwise passengers. The humblest Indian inthe obscurest village on the coast was familiar with theCerberus, a little black puffer without charm or livingaccommodation to speak of, whose mission was to creep inshorealong the wooded beaches close to mighty ugly rocks, stoppingobligingly before every cluster of huts to collect produce, downto three-pound parcels of indiarubber bound in a wrapper of drygrass.And as they seldom failed to account for the smallest package,rarely lost a bullock, and had never drowned a single passenger,the name of the O.S.N. stood very high for trustworthiness.People declared that under the Company's care their lives andproperty were safer on the water than in their own houses onshore.The O.S.N.'s superintendent in Sulaco for the whole Costaguanasection of the service was very proud of his Company's standing.He resumed it in a saying which was very often on his lips, "Wenever make mistakes." To the Company's officers it took the formof a severe injunction, "We must make no mistakes. I'll have nomistakes here, no matter what Smith may do at his end."Smith, on whom he had never set eyes in his life, was the othersuperintendent of the service, quartered some fifteen hundredmiles away from Sulaco. "Don't talk to me of your Smith."Then, calming down suddenly, he would dismiss the subject withstudied negligence."Smith knows no more of this continent than a baby.""Our excellent Senor Mitchell" for the business and officialworld of Sulaco; "Fussy Joe" for the commanders of the Company'sships, Captain Joseph Mitchell prided himself on his profoundknowledge of men and things in the country--cosas de Costaguana.Amongst these last he accounted as most unfavourable to theorderly working of his Company the frequent changes of governmentbrought about by revolutions of the military type.The political atmosphere of the Republic was generally stormy inthese days. The fugitive patriots of the defeated party had theknack of turning up again on the coast with half a steamer's loadof small arms and ammunition. Such resourcefulness CaptainMitchell considered as perfectly wonderful in view of their utterdestitution at the time of flight. He had observed that "theynever seemed to have enough change about them to pay for theirpassage ticket out of the country." And he could speak withknowledge; for on a memorable occasion he had been called upon tosave the life of a dictator, together with the lives of a fewSulaco officials--the political chief, the director of thecustoms, and the head of police--belonging to an overturnedgovernment. Poor Senor Ribiera (such was the dictator's name) hadcome pelting eighty miles over mountain tracks after the lostbattle of Socorro, in the hope of out-distancing the fatalnews--which, of course, he could not manage to do on a lame mule.The animal, moreover, expired under him at the end of theAlameda, where the military band plays sometimes in the eveningsbetween the revolutions. "Sir," Captain Mitchell would pursuewith portentous gravity, "the ill-timed end of that muleattracted attention to the unfortunate rider. His features wererecognized by several deserters from the Dictatorial army amongstthe rascally mob already engaged in smashing the windows of theIntendencia."Early on the morning of that day the local authorities of Sulacohad fled for refuge to the O.S.N. Company's offices, a strongbuilding near the shore end of the jetty, leaving the town to themercies of a revolutionary rabble; and as the Dictator wasexecrated by the populace on account of the severe recruitmentlaw his necessities had compelled him to enforce during thestruggle, he stood a good chance of being torn to pieces.Providentially, Nostromo--invaluable fellow--with some Italianworkmen, imported to work upon the National Central Railway, wasat hand, and managed to snatch him away--for the time at least.Ultimately, Captain Mitchell succeeded in taking everybody off inhis own gig to one of the Company's steamers--it was theMinerva--just then, as luck would have it, entering the harbour.He had to lower these gentlemen at the end of a rope out of ahole in the wall at the back, while the mob which, pouring out ofthe town, had spread itself all along the shore, howled andfoamed at the foot of the building in front. He had to hurry themthen the whole length of the jetty; it had been a desperate dash,neck or nothing--and again it was Nostromo, a fellow in athousand, who, at the head, this time, of the Company's body oflightermen, held the jetty against the rushes of the rabble, thusgiving the fugitives time to reach the gig lying ready for themat the other end with the Company's flag at the stern. Sticks,stones, shots flew; knives, too, were thrown. Captain Mitchellexhibited willingly the long cicatrice of a cut over his left earand temple, made by a razor-blade fastened to a stick--a weapon,he explained, very much in favour with the "worst kind of niggerout here."Captain Mitchell was a thick, elderly man, wearing high, pointedcollars and short side-whiskers, partial to white waistcoats, andreally very communicative under his air of pompous reserve."These gentlemen," he would say, staring with great solemnity,"had to run like rabbits, sir. I ran like a rabbit myself.Certain forms of death are--er--distasteful toa--a--er--respectable man. They would have pounded me to death,too. A crazy mob, sir, does not discriminate. Under providence weowed our preservation to my Capataz de Cargadores, as they calledhim in the town, a man who, when I discovered his value, sir, wasjust the bos'n of an Italian ship, a big Genoese ship, one of thefew European ships that ever came to Sulaco with a general cargobefore the building of the National Central. He left her onaccount of some very respectable friends he made here, his owncountrymen, but also, I suppose, to better himself.  Sir, I am apretty good judge of character. I engaged him to be the foremanof our lightermen, and caretaker of our jetty. That's all that hewas. But without him Senor Ribiera would have been a dead man.This Nostromo, sir, a man absolutely above reproach, became theterror of all the thieves in the town. We were infested,infested, overrun, sir, here at that time by ladrones andmatreros, thieves and murderers from the whole province. On thisoccasion they had been flocking into Sulaco for a week past.They had scented the end, sir. Fifty per cent. of that murderingmob were professional bandits from the Campo, sir, but therewasn't one that hadn't heard of Nostromo. As to the town leperos,sir, the sight of his black whiskers and white teeth was enoughfor them.  They quailed before him, sir. That's what the force ofcharacter will do for you."It could very well be said that it was Nostromo alone who savedthe lives of these gentlemen. Captain Mitchell, on his part,never left them till he had seen them collapse, panting,terrified, and exasperated, but safe, on the luxuriant velvetsofas in the first-class saloon of the Minerva. To the very lasthe had been careful to address the ex-Dictator as "YourExcellency.""Sir, I could do no other. The man was down--ghastly, livid, onemass of scratches."The Minerva never let go her anchor that call. The superintendentordered her out of the harbour at once.  No cargo could belanded, of course, and the passengers for Sulaco naturallyrefused to go ashore. They could hear the firing and see plainlythe fight going on at the edge of the water. The repulsed mobdevoted its energies to an attack upon the Custom House, adreary, unfinished-looking structure with many windows twohundred yards away from the O.S.N. Offices, and the only otherbuilding near the harbour. Captain Mitchell, after directing thecommander of the Minerva to land "these gentlemen" in the firstport of call outside Costaguana, went back in his gig to see whatcould be done for the protection of the Company's property.  Thatand the property of the railway were preserved by the Europeanresidents; that is, by Captain Mitchell himself and the staff ofengineers building the road, aided by the Italian and Basqueworkmen who rallied faithfully round their English chiefs. TheCompany's lightermen, too, natives of the Republic, behaved verywell under their Capataz. An outcast lot of very mixed blood,mainly negroes, everlastingly at feud with the other customers oflow grog shops in the town, they embraced with delight thisopportunity to settle their personal scores under such favourableauspices. There was not one of them that had not, at some time orother, looked with terror at Nostromo's revolver poked very closeat his face, or been otherwise daunted by Nostromo's resolution.He was "much of a man," their Capataz was, they said, tooscornful in his temper ever to utter abuse, a tirelesstaskmaster, and the more to be feared because of his aloofness.And behold!  there he was that day, at their head, condescendingto make jocular remarks to this man or the other.Such leadership was inspiriting, and in truth all the harm themob managed to achieve was to set fire to one--only one--stackof railway-sleepers, which, being creosoted, burned well. Themain attack on the railway yards, on the O.S.N. Offices, andespecially on the Custom House, whose strong room, it was wellknown, contained a large treasure in silver ingots, failedcompletely.  Even the little hotel kept by old Giorgio, standingalone halfway between the harbour and the town, escaped lootingand destruction, not by a miracle, but because with the safes inview they had neglected it at first, and afterwards found noleisure to stop. Nostromo, with his Cargadores, was pressing themtoo hard then.CHAPTER THREEIT MIGHT have been said that there he was only protecting hisown. From the first he had been admitted to live in the intimacyof the family of the hotel-keeper who was a countryman of his.Old Giorgio Viola, a Genoese with a shaggy white leoninehead--often called simply "the Garibaldino" (as Mohammedans arecalled after their prophet)--was, to use Captain Mitchell's ownwords, the "respectable married friend" by whose advice Nostromohad left his ship to try for a run of shore luck in Costaguana.The old man, full of scorn for the populace, as your austererepublican so often is, had disregarded the preliminary sounds oftrouble. He went on that day as usual pottering about the "casa"in his slippers, muttering angrily to himself his contempt of thenon-political nature of the riot, and shrugging his shoulders.In the end he was taken unawares by the out-rush of the rabble.It was too late then to remove his family, and, indeed, wherecould he have run to with the portly Signora Teresa and twolittle girls on that great plain?  So, barricading every opening,the old man sat down sternly in the middle of the darkened cafewith an old shot-gun on his knees. His wife sat on another chairby his side, muttering pious invocations to all the saints of thecalendar.The old republican did not believe in saints, or in prayers, orin what he called "priest's religion." Liberty and Garibaldi werehis divinities; but he tolerated "superstition" in women,preserving in these matters a lofty and silent attitude.His two girls, the eldest fourteen, and the other two yearsyounger, crouched on the sanded floor, on each side of theSignora Teresa, with their heads on their mother's lap, bothscared, but each in her own way, the dark-haired Linda indignantand angry, the fair Giselle, the younger, bewildered andresigned. The Patrona removed her arms, which embraced herdaughters, for a moment to cross herself and wring her handshurriedly.  She moaned a little louder."Oh! Gian' Battista, why art thou not here? Oh!  why art thou nothere?"She was not then invoking the saint himself, but calling uponNostromo, whose patron he was. And Giorgio, motionless on thechair by her side, would be provoked by these reproachful anddistracted appeals."Peace, woman! Where's the sense of it? There's his duty," hemurmured in the dark; and she would retort, panting--"Eh! I have no patience. Duty! What of the woman who has beenlike a mother to him? I bent my knee to him this morning; don'tyou go out, Gian' Battista--stop in the house, Battistino--lookat those two little innocent children!"Mrs. Viola was an Italian, too, a native of Spezzia, and thoughconsiderably younger than her husband, already middle-aged. Shehad a handsome face, whose complexion had turned yellow becausethe climate of Sulaco did not suit her at all. Her voice was arich contralto. When, with her arms folded tight under her amplebosom, she scolded the squat, thick-legged China girls handlinglinen, plucking fowls, pounding corn in wooden mortars amongstthe mud outbuildings at the back of the house, she could bringout such an impassioned, vibrating, sepulchral note that thechained watch-dog bolted into his kennel with a great rattle.Luis, a cinnamon-coloured mulatto with a sprouting moustache andthick, dark lips, would stop sweeping the cafe with a broom ofpalm-leaves to let a gentle shudder run down his spine. Hislanguishing almond eyes would remain closed for a long time.This was the staff of the Casa Viola, but all these people hadfled early that morning at the first sounds of the riot,preferring to hide on the plain rather than trust themselves inthe house; a preference for which they were in no way to blame,since, whether true or not, it was generally believed in the townthat the Garibaldino had some money buried under the clay floorof the kitchen. The dog, an irritable, shaggy brute, barkedviolently and whined plaintively in turns at the back, running inand out of his kennel as rage or fear prompted him.Bursts of great shouting rose and died away, like wild gusts ofwind on the plain round the barricaded house; the fitful poppingof shots grew louder above the yelling.  Sometimes there wereintervals of unaccountable stillness outside, and nothing couldhave been more gaily peaceful than the narrow bright lines ofsunlight from the cracks in the shutters, ruled straight acrossthe cafe over the disarranged chairs and tables to the wallopposite. Old Giorgio had chosen that bare, whitewashed room fora retreat. It had only one window, and its only door swung outupon the track of thick dust fenced by aloe hedges between theharbour and the town, where clumsy carts used to creak alongbehind slow yokes of oxen guided by boys on horseback.In a pause of stillness Giorgio cocked his gun. The ominous soundwrung a low moan from the rigid figure of the woman sitting byhis side. A sudden outbreak of defiant yelling quite near thehouse sank all at once to a confused murmur of growls. Somebodyran along; the loud catching of his breath was heard for aninstant passing the door; there were hoarse mutters and footstepsnear the wall; a shoulder rubbed against the shutter, effacingthe bright lines of sunshine pencilled across the whole breadthof the room. Signora Teresa's arms thrown about the kneelingforms of her daughters embraced them closer with a convulsivepressure.The mob, driven away from the Custom House, had broken up intoseveral bands, retreating across the plain in the direction ofthe town. The subdued crash of irregular volleys fired in thedistance was answered by faint yells far away. In the intervalsthe single shots rang feebly, and the low, long, white buildingblinded in every window seemed to be the centre of a turmoilwidening in a great circle about its closed-up silence.  But thecautious movements and whispers of a routed party seeking amomentary shelter behind the wall made the darkness of the room,striped by threads of quiet sunlight, alight with evil, stealthysounds. The Violas had them in their ears as though invisibleghosts hovering about their chairs had consulted in mutters as tothe advisability of setting fire to this foreigner's casa.It was trying to the nerves. Old Viola had risen slowly, gun inhand, irresolute, for he did not see how he could prevent them.Already voices could be heard talking at the back. Signora Teresawas beside herself with terror."Ah! the traitor! the traitor!" she mumbled, almost inaudibly."Now we are going to be burnt; and I bent my knee to him. No! hemust run at the heels of his English."She seemed to think that Nostromo's mere presence in the housewould have made it perfectly safe. So far, she, too, was underthe spell of that reputation the Capataz de Cargadores had madefor himself by the waterside, along the railway line, with theEnglish and with the populace of Sulaco. To his face, and evenagainst her husband, she invariably affected to laugh it toscorn, sometimes good-naturedly, more often with a curiousbitterness. But then women are unreasonable in their opinions, asGiorgio used to remark calmly on fitting occasions. On thisoccasion, with his gun held at ready before him, he stooped downto his wife's head, and, keeping his eyes steadfastly on thebarricaded door, he breathed out into her ear that Nostromo wouldhave been powerless to help. What could two men shut up in ahouse do against twenty or more bent upon setting fire to theroof? Gian' Battista was thinking of the casa all the time, hewas sure."He think of the casa! He!" gasped Signora Viola, crazily. Shestruck her breast with her open hands.  "I know him. He thinks ofnobody but himself."A discharge of firearms near by made her throw her head back andclose her eyes. Old Giorgio set his teeth hard under his whitemoustache, and his eyes began to roll fiercely. Several bulletsstruck the end of the wall together; pieces of plaster could beheard falling outside; a voice screamed "Here they come!" andafter a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush of running feetalong the front.Then the tension of old Giorgio's attitude relaxed, and a smileof contemptuous relief came upon his lips of an old fighter witha leonine face. These were not a people striving for justice, butthieves. Even to defend his life against them was a sort ofdegradation for a man who had been one of Garibaldi's immortalthousand in the conquest of Sicily. He had an immense scorn forthis outbreak of scoundrels and leperos, who did not know themeaning of the word "liberty."He grounded his old gun, and, turning his head, glanced at thecoloured lithograph of Garibaldi in a black frame on the whitewall; a thread of strong sunshine cut it perpendicularly. Hiseyes, accustomed to the luminous twilight, made out the highcolouring of the face, the red of the shirt, the outlines of thesquare shoulders, the black patch of the Bersagliere hat withcock's feathers curling over the crown. An immortal hero! Thiswas your liberty; it gave you not only life, but immortality aswell!For that one man his fanaticism had suffered no diminution. Inthe moment of relief from the apprehension of the greatestdanger, perhaps, his family had been exposed to in all theirwanderings, he had turned to the picture of his old chief, firstand only, then laid his hand on his wife's shoulder.The children kneeling on the floor had not moved.  Signora Teresaopened her eyes a little, as though he had awakened her from avery deep and dreamless slumber. Before he had time in hisdeliberate way to say a reassuring word she jumped up, with thechildren clinging to her, one on each side, gasped for breath,and let out a hoarse shriek.It was simultaneous with the bang of a violent blow struck on theoutside of the shutter. They could hear suddenly the snorting ofa horse, the restive tramping of hoofs on the narrow, hard pathin front of the house; the toe of a boot struck at the shutteragain; a spur jingled at every blow, and an excited voiceshouted, "Hola!  hola, in there!"CHAPTER FOURALL the morning Nostromo had kept his eye from afar on the CasaViola, even in the thick of the hottest scrimmage near the CustomHouse. "If I see smoke rising over there," he thought to himself,"they are lost." Directly the mob had broken he pressed with asmall band of Italian workmen in that direction, which, indeed,was the shortest line towards the town. That part of the rabblehe was pursuing seemed to think of making a stand under thehouse; a volley fired by his followers from behind an aloe hedgemade the rascals fly. In a gap chopped out for the rails of theharbour branch line Nostromo appeared, mounted on his silver-greymare. He shouted, sent after them one shot from his revolver, andgalloped up to the cafe window. He had an idea that old Giorgiowould choose that part of the house for a refuge.His voice had penetrated to them, sounding breathlessly hurried:"Hola! Vecchio! O, Vecchio! Is it all well with you in there?""You see--" murmured old Viola to his wife.  Signora Teresa wassilent now. Outside Nostromo laughed."I can hear the padrona is not dead.""You have done your best to kill me with fear," cried SignoraTeresa. She wanted to say something more, but her voice failedher.Linda raised her eyes to her face for a moment, but old Giorgioshouted apologetically--"She is a little upset."Outside Nostromo shouted back with another laugh--"She cannot upset me."Signora Teresa found her voice."It is what I say. You have no heart--and you have no conscience,Gian' Battista--"They heard him wheel his horse away from the shutters. The partyhe led were babbling excitedly in Italian and Spanish, incitingeach other to the pursuit.  He put himself at their head, crying,"Avanti!""He has not stopped very long with us. There is no praise fromstrangers to be got here," Signora Teresa said tragically."Avanti! Yes! That is all he cares for. To be firstsomewhere--somehow--to be first with these English. They will beshowing him to everybody. 'This is our Nostromo!'" She laughedominously. "What a name! What is that? Nostromo? He would take aname that is properly no word from them."Meantime Giorgio, with tranquil movements, had been unfasteningthe door; the flood of light fell on Signora Teresa, with her twogirls gathered to her side, a picturesque woman in a pose ofmaternal exaltation.  Behind her the wall was dazzlingly white,and the crude colours of the Garibaldi lithograph paled in thesunshine.Old Viola, at the door, moved his arm upwards as if referring allhis quick, fleeting thoughts to the picture of his old chief onthe wall. Even when he was cooking for the "Signori Inglesi"--theengineers (he was a famous cook, though the kitchen was a darkplace)--he was, as it were, under the eye of the great man whohad led him in a glorious struggle where, under the walls ofGaeta, tyranny would have expired for ever had it not been forthat accursed Piedmontese race of kings and ministers. Whensometimes a frying-pan caught fire during a delicate operationwith some shredded onions, and the old man was seen backing outof the doorway, swearing and coughing violently in an acrid cloudof smoke, the name of Cavour--the arch intriguer sold to kingsand tyrants--could be heard involved in imprecations against theChina girls, cooking in general, and the brute of a country wherehe was reduced to live for the love of liberty that traitor hadstrangled.Then Signora Teresa, all in black, issuing from another door,advanced, portly and anxious, inclining her fine, black-browedhead, opening her arms, and crying in a profound tone--"Giorgio! thou passionate man!   Misericordia Divina! In the sunlike this! He will make himself ill."At her feet the hens made off in all directions, with immensestrides; if there were any engineers from up the line staying inSulaco, a young English face or two would appear at thebilliard-room occupying one end of the house; but at the otherend, in the cafe, Luis, the mulatto, took good care not to showhimself. The Indian girls, with hair like flowing black manes,and dressed only in a shift and short petticoat, stared dullyfrom under the square-cut fringes on their foreheads; the noisyfrizzling of fat had stopped, the fumes floated upwards insunshine, a strong smell of burnt onions hung in the drowsy heat,enveloping the house; and the eye lost itself in a vast flatexpanse of grass to the west, as if the plain between the Sierraovertopping Sulaco and the coast range away there towardsEsmeralda had been as big as half the world.Signora Teresa, after an impressive pause, remonstrated--"Eh, Giorgio! Leave Cavour alone and take care of yourself now weare lost in this country all alone with the two children, becauseyou cannot live under a king."And while she looked at him she would sometimes put her handhastily to her side with a short twitch of her fine lips and aknitting of her black, straight eyebrows like a flicker of angrypain or an angry thought on her handsome, regular features.It was pain; she suppressed the twinge. It had come to her firsta few years after they had left Italy to emigrate to America andsettle at last in Sulaco after wandering from town to town,trying shopkeeping in a small way here and there; and once anorganized enterprise of fishing--in Maldonado--for Giorgio, likethe great Garibaldi, had been a sailor in his time.Sometimes she had no patience with pain. For years its gnawinghad been part of the landscape embracing the glitter of theharbour under the wooded spurs of the range; and the sunshineitself was heavy and dull--heavy with pain--not like thesunshine of her girlhood, in which middle-aged Giorgio had wooedher gravely and passionately on the shores of the gulf ofSpezzia."You go in at once, Giorgio," she directed. "One would think youdo not wish to have any pity on me--with four Signori Inglesistaying in the house." "Va bene, va bene," Giorgio would mutter.He obeyed. The Signori Inglesi would require their midday mealpresently.  He had been one of the immortal and invincible bandof liberators who had made the mercenaries of tyranny fly likechaff before a hurricane, "un uragano terribile." But that wasbefore he was married and had children; and before tyranny hadreared its head again amongst the traitors who had imprisonedGaribaldi, his hero.There were three doors in the front of the house, and eachafternoon the Garibaldino could be seen at one or another of themwith his big bush of white hair, his arms folded, his legscrossed, leaning back his leonine head against the side, andlooking up the wooded slopes of the foothills at the snowy domeof Higuerota.  The front of his house threw off a black longrectangle of shade, broadening slowly over the soft ox-carttrack.  Through the gaps, chopped out in the oleander hedges, theharbour branch railway, laid out temporarily on the level of theplain, curved away its shining parallel ribbons on a belt ofscorched and withered grass within sixty yards of the end of thehouse. In the evening the empty material trains of flat carscircled round the dark green grove of Sulaco, and ran, undulatingslightly with white jets of steam, over the plain towards theCasa Viola, on their way to the railway yards by the harbour. TheItalian drivers saluted him from the foot-plate with raised hand,while the negro brakesmen sat carelessly on the brakes, lookingstraight forward, with the rims of their big hats flapping in thewind. In return Giorgio would give a slight sideways jerk of thehead, without unfolding his arms.On this memorable day of the riot his arms were not folded on hischest. His hand grasped the barrel of the gun grounded on thethreshold; he did not look up once at the white dome ofHiguerota, whose cool purity seemed to hold itself aloof from ahot earth. His eyes examined the plain curiously. Tall trails ofdust subsided here and there. In a speckless sky the sun hungclear and blinding. Knots of men ran headlong; others made astand; and the irregular rattle of firearms came rippling to hisears in the fiery, still air. Single figures on foot raceddesperately. Horsemen galloped towards each other, wheeled roundtogether, separated at speed. Giorgio saw one fall, rider andhorse disappearing as if they had galloped into a chasm, and themovements of the animated scene were like the passages of aviolent game played upon the plain by dwarfs mounted and on foot,yelling with tiny throats, under the mountain that seemed acolossal embodiment of silence. Never before had Giorgio seenthis bit of plain so full of active life; his gaze could not takein all its details at once; he shaded his eyes with his hand,till suddenly the thundering of many hoofs near by startled him.A troop of horses had broken out of the fenced paddock of theRailway Company. They came on like a whirlwind, and dashed overthe line snorting, kicking, squealing in a compact, piebald,tossing mob of bay, brown, grey backs, eyes staring, necksextended, nostrils red, long tails streaming. As soon as they hadleaped upon the road the thick dust flew upwards from under theirhoofs, and within six yards of Giorgio only a brown cloud withvague forms of necks and cruppers rolled by, making the soiltremble on its passage.Viola coughed, turning his face away from the dust, and shakinghis head slightly."There will be some horse-catching to be done before to-night,"he muttered.In the square of sunlight falling through the door SignoraTeresa, kneeling before the chair, had bowed her head, heavy witha twisted mass of ebony hair streaked with silver, into the palmof her hands. The black lace shawl she used to drape about herface had dropped to the ground by her side. The two girls had gotup, hand-in-hand, in short skirts, their loose hair falling indisorder. The younger had thrown her arm across her eyes, as ifafraid to face the light. Linda, with her hand on the other'sshoulder, stared fearlessly.  Viola looked at his children.  Thesun brought out the deep lines on his face, and, energetic inexpression, it had the immobility of a carving. It was impossibleto discover what he thought.  Bushy grey eyebrows shaded his darkglance."Well! And do you not pray like your mother?"Linda pouted, advancing her red lips, which were almost too red;but she had admirable eyes, brown, with a sparkle of gold in theirises, full of intelligence and meaning, and so clear that theyseemed to throw a glow upon her thin, colourless face. There werebronze glints in the sombre clusters of her hair, and theeyelashes, long and coal black, made her complexion appear stillmore pale."Mother is going to offer up a lot of candles in the church. Shealways does when Nostromo has been away fighting. I shall havesome to carry up to the Chapel of the Madonna in the Cathedral."She said all this quickly, with great assurance, in an animated,penetrating voice. Then, giving her sister's shoulder a slightshake, she added--"And she will be made to carry one, too!""Why made?" inquired Giorgio, gravely. "Does she not want to?""She is timid," said Linda, with a little burst of laughter."People notice her fair hair as she goes along with us. They callout after her, 'Look at the Rubia!  Look at the Rubiacita!' Theycall out in the streets.  She is timid.""And you? You are not timid--eh?" the father pronounced, slowly.She tossed back all her dark hair."Nobody calls out after me."Old Giorgio contemplated his children thoughtfully.  There wastwo years difference between them. They had been born to himlate, years after the boy had died.  Had he lived he would havebeen nearly as old as Gian' Battista--he whom the English calledNostromo; but as to his daughters, the severity of his temper,his advancing age, his absorption in his memories, had preventedhis taking much notice of them.  He loved his children, but girlsbelong more to the mother, and much of his affection had beenexpended in the worship and service of liberty.When quite a youth he had deserted from a ship trading to LaPlata, to enlist in the navy of Montevideo, then under thecommand of Garibaldi. Afterwards, in the Italian legion of theRepublic struggling against the encroaching tyranny of Rosas, hehad taken part, on great plains, on the banks of immense rivers,in the fiercest fighting perhaps the world had ever known.  Hehad lived amongst men who had declaimed about liberty, sufferedfor liberty, died for liberty, with a desperate exaltation, andwith their eyes turned towards an oppressed Italy. His ownenthusiasm had been fed on scenes of carnage, on the examples oflofty devotion, on the din of armed struggle, on the inflamedlanguage of proclamations. He had never parted from the chief ofhis choice--the fiery apostle of independence--keeping by hisside in America and in Italy till after the fatal day ofAspromonte, when the treachery of kings, emperors, and ministershad been revealed to the world in the wounding and imprisonmentof his hero--a catastrophe that had instilled into him a gloomydoubt of ever being able to understand the ways of Divinejustice.He did not deny it, however. It required patience, he would say.Though he disliked priests, and would not put his foot inside achurch for anything, he believed in God. Were not theproclamations against tyrants addressed to the peoples in thename of God and liberty?  "God for men--religions for women," hemuttered sometimes. In Sicily, an Englishman who had turned up inPalermo after its evacuation by the army of the king, had givenhim a Bible in Italian--the publication of the British andForeign Bible Society, bound in a dark leather cover. In periodsof political adversity, in the pauses of silence when therevolutionists issued no proclamations, Giorgio earned his livingwith the first work that came to hand--as sailor, as docklabourer on the quays of Genoa, once as a hand on a farm in thehills above Spezzia--and in his spare time he studied the thickvolume. He carried it with him into battles. Now it was his onlyreading, and in order not to be deprived of it (the print wassmall) he had consented to accept the present of a pair ofsilver-mounted spectacles from Senora Emilia Gould, the wife ofthe Englishman who managed the silver mine in the mountains threeleagues from the town. She was the only Englishwoman in Sulaco.Giorgio Viola had a great consideration for the English. Thisfeeling, born on the battlefields of Uruguay, was forty years oldat the very least. Several of them had poured their blood for thecause of freedom in America, and the first he had ever known heremembered by the name of Samuel; he commanded a negro companyunder Garibaldi, during the famous siege of Montevideo, and diedheroically with his negroes at the fording of the Boyana. He,Giorgio, had reached the rank of ensign-alferez-and cooked forthe general. Later, in Italy, he, with the rank of lieutenant,rode with the staff and still cooked for the general. He hadcooked for him in Lombardy through the whole campaign; on themarch to Rome he had lassoed his beef in the Campagna after theAmerican manner; he had been wounded in the defence of the RomanRepublic; he was one of the four fugitives who, with the general,carried out of the woods the inanimate body of the general's wifeinto the farmhouse where she died, exhausted by the hardships ofthat terrible retreat.  He had survived that disastrous time toattend his general in Palermo when the Neapolitan shells from thecastle crashed upon the town. He had cooked for him on the fieldof Volturno after fighting all day. And everywhere he had seenEnglishmen in the front rank of the army of freedom. He respectedtheir nation because they loved Garibaldi. Their very countessesand princesses had kissed the general's hands in London, it wassaid. He could well believe it; for the nation was noble, and theman was a saint. It was enough to look once at his face to seethe divine force of faith in him and his great pity for all thatwas poor, suffering, and oppressed in this world.The spirit of self-forgetfulness, the simple devotion to a vasthumanitarian idea which inspired the thought and stress of thatrevolutionary time, had left its mark upon Giorgio in a sort ofaustere contempt for all personal advantage. This man, whom thelowest class in Sulaco suspected of having a buried hoard in hiskitchen, had all his life despised money. The leaders of hisyouth had lived poor, had died poor. It had been a habit of hismind to disregard to-morrow. It was engendered partly by anexistence of excitement, adventure, and wild warfare. But mostlyit was a matter of principle. It did not resemble thecarelessness of a condottiere, it was a puritanism of conduct,born of stern enthusiasm like the puritanism of religion.This stern devotion to a cause had cast a gloom upon Giorgio'sold age. It cast a gloom because the cause seemed lost. Too manykings and emperors flourished yet in the world which God hadmeant for the people.  He was sad because of his simplicity.Though always ready to help his countrymen, and greatly respectedby the Italian emigrants wherever he lived (in his exile hecalled it), he could not conceal from himself that they carednothing for the wrongs of down-trodden nations.  They listened tohis tales of war readily, but seemed to ask themselves what hehad got out of it after all.  There was nothing that they couldsee. "We wanted nothing, we suffered for the love of allhumanity!" he cried out furiously sometimes, and the powerfulvoice, the blazing eyes, the shaking of the white mane, thebrown, sinewy hand pointing upwards as if to call heaven towitness, impressed his hearers. After the old man hadbroken offabruptly with a jerk of the head and a movement of the arm,meaning clearly, "But what's the good of talking to you?" theynudged each other.  There was in old Giorgio an energy offeeling, a personal quality of conviction, something they called"terribilita"--"an old lion," they used to say of him. Someslight incident, a chance word would set him off talking on thebeach to the Italian fishermen of Maldonado, in the little shophe kept afterwards (in Valparaiso) to his countrymen customers;of an evening, suddenly, in the cafe at one end of the Casa Viola(the other was reserved for the English engineers) to the selectclientele of engine-drivers and foremen of the railway shops.With their handsome, bronzed, lean faces, shiny black ringlets,glistening eyes, broad-chested, bearded, sometimes a tiny goldring in the lobe of the ear, the aristocracy of the railway workslistened to him, turning away from their cards or dominoes. Hereand there a fair-haired Basque studied his hand meantime, waitingwithout protest. No native of Costaguana intruded there. This wasthe Italian stronghold. Even the Sulaco policemen on a nightpatrol let their horses pace softly by, bending low in the saddleto glance through the window at the heads in a fog of smoke; andthe drone of old Giorgio's declamatory narrative seemed to sinkbehind them into the plain.  Only now and then the assistant ofthe chief of police, some broad-faced, brown little gentleman,with a great deal of Indian in him, would put in an appearance.Leaving his man outside with the horses he advanced with aconfident, sly smile, and without a word up to the long trestletable. He pointed to one of the bottles on the shelf; Giorgio,thrusting his pipe into his mouth abruptly, served him in person.Nothing would be heard but the slight jingle of the spurs. Hisglass emptied, he would take a leisurely, scrutinizing look allround the room, go out, and ride away slowly, circling towardsthe town.CHAPTER FIVEIN THIS way only was the power of the local authoritiesvindicated amongst the great body of strong-limbed foreigners whodug the earth, blasted the rocks, drove the engines for the"progressive and patriotic undertaking." In these very wordseighteen months before the Excellentissimo Senor don VincenteRibiera, the Dictator of Costaguana, had described the NationalCentral Railway in his great speech at the turning of the firstsod.He had come on purpose to Sulaco, and there was a one-o'clockdinner-party, a convite offered by the O.S.N.  Company on boardthe Juno after the function on shore.  Captain Mitchell hadhimself steered the cargo lighter, all draped with flags, which,in tow of the Juno's steam launch, took the Excellentissimo fromthe jetty to the ship. Everybody of note in Sulaco had beeninvited--the one or two foreign merchants, all therepresentatives of the old Spanish families then in town, thegreat owners of estates on the plain, grave, courteous, simplemen, caballeros of pure descent, with small hands and feet,conservative, hospitable, and kind. The Occidental Province wastheir stronghold; their Blanco party had triumphed now; it wastheir President-Dictator, a Blanco of the Blancos, who satsmiling urbanely between the representatives of two friendlyforeign powers. They had come with him from Sta.  Marta tocountenance by their presence the enterprise in which the capitalof their countries was engaged.  The only lady of that companywas Mrs. Gould, the wife of Don Carlos, the administrator of theSan Tome silver mine. The ladies of Sulaco were not advancedenough to take part in the public life to that extent.  They hadcome out strongly at the great ball at the Intendencia theevening before, but Mrs. Gould alone had appeared, a bright spotin the group of black coats behind the President-Dictator, on thecrimson cloth-covered stage erected under a shady tree on theshore of the harbour, where the ceremony of turning the first sodhad taken place. She had come off in the cargo lighter, full ofnotabilities, sitting under the flutter of gay flags, in theplace of honour by the side of Captain Mitchell, who steered, andher clear dress gave the only truly festive note to the sombregathering in the long, gorgeous saloon of the Juno.The head of the chairman of the railway board (from London),handsome and pale in a silvery mist of white hair and clippedbeard, hovered near her shoulder attentive, smiling, andfatigued. The journey from London to Sta. Marta in mail boats andthe special carriages of the Sta. Marta coast-line (the onlyrailway so far) had been tolerable--even pleasant--quitetolerable.  But the trip over the mountains to Sulaco was anothersort of experience, in an old diligencia over impassable roadsskirting awful precipices."We have been upset twice in one day on the brink of very deepravines," he was telling Mrs. Gould in an undertone. "And when wearrived here at last I don't know what we should have donewithout your hospitality.  What an out-of-the-way place Sulacois!--and for a harbour, too! Astonishing!""Ah, but we are very proud of it. It used to be historicallyimportant. The highest ecclesiastical court for twoviceroyalties, sat here in the olden time," she instructed himwith animation."I am impressed. I didn't mean to be disparaging.  You seem verypatriotic.""The place is lovable, if only by its situation. Perhaps youdon't know what an old resident I am.""How old, I wonder," he murmured, looking at her with a slightsmile. Mrs. Gould's appearance was made youthful by the mobileintelligence of her face.  "We can't give you your ecclesiasticalcourt back again; but you shall have more steamers, a railway, atelegraph-cable--a future in the great world which is worthinfinitely more than any amount of ecclesiastical past.  Youshall be brought in touch with something greater than twoviceroyalties. But I had no notion that a place on a sea-coastcould remain so isolated from the world. If it had been athousand miles inland now--most remarkable! Has anything everhappened here for a hundred years before to-day?"While he talked in a slow, humorous tone, she kept her littlesmile. Agreeing ironically, she assured him that certainlynot--nothing ever happened in Sulaco.  Even the revolutions, ofwhich there had been two in her time, had respected the repose ofthe place.  Their course ran in the more populous southern partsof the Republic, and the great valley of Sta. Marta, which waslike one great battlefield of the parties, with the possession ofthe capital for a prize and an outlet to another ocean. They weremore advanced over there.   Here in Sulaco they heard only theechoes of these great questions, and, of course, their officialworld changed each time, coming to them over their rampart ofmountains which he himself had traversed in an old diligencia,with such a risk to life and limb.The chairman of the railway had been enjoying her hospitality forseveral days, and he was really grateful for it. It was onlysince he had left Sta. Marta that he had utterly lost touch withthe feeling of European life on the background of his exoticsurroundings. In the capital he had been the guest of theLegation, and had been kept busy negotiating with the members ofDon Vincente's Government--cultured men, men to whom theconditions of civilized business were not unknown.What concerned him most at the time was the acquisition of landfor the railway. In the Sta. Marta Valley, where there wasalready one line in existence, the people were tractable, and itwas only a matter of price. A commission had been nominated tofix the values, and the difficulty resolved itself into thejudicious influencing of the Commissioners. But in Sulaco--theOccidental Province for whose very development the railway wasintended--there had been trouble. It had been lying for agesensconced behind its natural barriers, repelling modernenterprise by the precipices of its mountain range, by itsshallow harbour opening into the everlasting calms of a gulf fullof clouds, by the benighted state of mind of the owners of itsfertile territory--all these aristocratic old Spanish families,all those Don Ambrosios this and Don Fernandos that, who seemedactually to dislike and distrust the coming of the railway overtheir lands. It had happened that some of the surveying partiesscattered all over the province had been warned off with threatsof violence. In other cases outrageous pretensions as to pricehad been raised.  But the man of railways prided himself on beingequal to every emergency. Since he was met by the inimicalsentiment of blind conservatism in Sulaco he would meet it bysentiment, too, before taking his stand on his right alone. TheGovernment was bound to carry out its part of the contract withthe board of the new railway company, even if it had to use forcefor the purpose. But he desired nothing less than an armeddisturbance in the smooth working of his plans. They were muchtoo vast and far-reaching, and too promising to leave a stoneunturned; and so he imagined to get the President-Dictator overthere on a tour of ceremonies and speeches, culminating in agreat function at the turning of the first sod by the harbourshore.  After all he was their own creature--that Don Vincente.He was the embodied triumph of the best elements in the State.These were facts, and, unless facts meant nothing, Sir Johnargued to himself, such a man's influence must be real, and hispersonal action would produce the conciliatory effect herequired. He had succeeded in arranging the trip with the help ofa very clever advocate, who was known in Sta. Marta as the agentof the Gould silver mine, the biggest thing in Sulaco, and evenin the whole Republic. It was indeed a fabulously rich mine. Itsso-called agent, evidently a man of culture and ability, seemed,without official position, to possess an extraordinary influencein the highest Government spheres. He was able to assure Sir Johnthat the President-Dictator would make the journey. He regretted,however, in the course of the same conversation, that GeneralMontero insisted upon going, too.General Montero, whom the beginning of the struggle had found anobscure army captain employed on the wild eastern frontier of theState, had thrown in his lot with the Ribiera party at a momentwhen special circumstances had given that small adhesion afortuitous importance. The fortunes of war served himmarvellously, and the victory of Rio Seco (after a day ofdesperate fighting) put a seal to his success. At the end heemerged General, Minister of War, and the military head of theBlanco party, although there was nothing aristocratic in hisdescent. Indeed, it was said that he and his brother, orphans,had been brought up by the munificence of a famous Europeantraveller, in whose service their father had lost his life.Another story was that their father had been nothing but acharcoal burner in the woods, and their mother a baptised Indianwoman from the far interior.However that might be, the Costaguana Press was in the habit ofstyling Montero's forest march from his commandancia to join theBlanco forces at the beginning of the troubles, the "most heroicmilitary exploit of modern times." About the same time, too, hisbrother had turned up from Europe, where he had gone apparentlyas secretary to a consul. Having, however, collected a small bandof outlaws, he showed some talent as guerilla chief and had beenrewarded at the pacification by the post of Military Commandantof the capital.The Minister of War, then, accompanied the Dictator.  The boardof the O.S.N. Company, working hand-in-hand with the railwaypeople for the good of the Republic, had on this importantoccasion instructed Captain Mitchell to put the mail-boat Juno atthe disposal of the distinguished party. Don Vincente, journeyingsouth from Sta. Marta, had embarked at Cayta, the principal portof Costaguana, and came to Sulaco by sea. But the chairman of therailway company had courageously crossed the mountains in aramshackle diligencia, mainly for the purpose of meeting hisengineer-in-chief engaged in the final survey of the road.For all the indifference of a man of affairs to nature, whosehostility can always be overcome by the resources of finance, hecould not help being impressed by his surroundings during hishalt at the surveying camp established at the highest point hisrailway was to reach. He spent the night there, arriving just toolate to see the last dying glow of sunlight upon the snowy flankof Higuerota. Pillared masses of black basalt framed like an openportal a portion of the white field lying aslant against thewest. In the transparent air of the high altitudes everythingseemed very near, steeped in a clear stillness as in animponderable liquid; and with his ear ready to catch the firstsound of the expected diligencia the engineer-in-chief, at thedoor of a hut of rough stones, had contemplated the changing hueson the enormous side of the mountain, thinking that in thissight, as in a piece of inspired music, there could be foundtogether the utmost delicacy of shaded expression and astupendous magnificence of effect.Sir John arrived too late to hear the magnificent John and inaudiblestrain sung by the sunset amongst the high peaks of the Sierra.It had sung itself out into the breathless pause of deep duskbefore, climbing down the fore wheel of the diligencia with stifflimbs, he shook hands with the engineer.They gave him his dinner in a stone hut like a cubical boulder,with no door or windows in its two openings; a bright fire ofsticks (brought on muleback from the first valley below) burningoutside, sent in a wavering glare; and two candles in tincandlesticks--lighted, it was explained to him, in hishonour--stood on a sort of rough camp table, at which he sat onthe right hand of the chief. He knew how to be amiable; and theyoung men of the engineering staff, for whom the surveying of therailway track had the glamour of the first steps on the path oflife, sat there, too, listening modestly, with their smooth facestanned by the weather, and very pleased to witness so muchaffability in so great a man.Afterwards, late at night, pacing to and fro outside, he had along talk with his chief engineer. He knew him well of old. Thiswas not the first undertaking in which their gifts, aselementally different as fire and water, had worked inconjunction. From the contact of these two personalities, who hadnot the same vision of the world, there was generated a power forthe world's service--a subtle force that could set in motionmighty machines, men's muscles, and awaken also in human breastsan unbounded devotion to the task. Of the young fellows at thetable, to whom the survey of the track was like the tracing ofthe path of life, more than one would be called to meet deathbefore the work was done. But the work would be done: the forcewould be almost as strong as a faith. Not quite, however. In thesilence of the sleeping camp upon the moonlit plateau forming thetop of the pass like the floor of a vast arena surrounded by thebasalt walls of precipices, two strolling figures in thickulsters stood still, and the voice of the engineer pronounceddistinctly the words--"We can't move mountains!"Sir John, raising his head to follow the pointing gesture, feltthe full force of the words. The white Higuerota soared out ofthe shadows of rock and earth like a frozen bubble under themoon. All was still, till near by, behind the wall of a corralfor the camp animals, built roughly of loose stones in the formof a circle, a pack mule stamped his forefoot and blew heavilytwice.The engineer-in-chief had used the phrase in answer to thechairman's tentative suggestion that the tracing of the linecould, perhaps, be altered in deference to the prejudices of theSulaco landowners. The chief engineer believed that the obstinacyof men was the lesser obstacle. Moreover, to combat that they hadthe great influence of Charles Gould, whereas tunnelling underHiguerota would have been a colossal undertaking."Ah, yes! Gould. What sort of a man is he?"Sir John had heard much of Charles Gould in Sta.  Marta, John andwanted to know more. The engineer-in-chief assured him that theadministrator of the San Tome silver mine had an immenseinfluence over all these Spanish Dons. He had also one of thebest houses in Sulaco, and the Gould hospitality was beyond allpraise."They received me as if they had known me for years," he said."The little lady is kindness personified.  I stayed with them fora month. He helped me to organize the surveying parties. Hispractical ownership of the San Tome silver mine gives him aspecial position. He seems to have the ear of every provincialauthority apparently, and, as I said, he can wind all thehidalgos of the province round his little finger. If you followhis advice the difficulties will fall away, because he wants therailway. Of course, you must be careful in what you say. He'sEnglish, and besides he must be immensely wealthy. The Holroydhouse is in with him in that mine, so you may imagine--"He interrupted himself as, from before one of the little firesburning outside the low wall of the corral, arose the figure of aman wrapped in a poncho up to the neck. The saddle which he hadbeen using for a pillow made a dark patch on the ground againstthe red glow of embers."I shall see Holroyd himself on my way back through the States,"said Sir John. "I've ascertained that he, too, wants therailway."The man who, perhaps disturbed by the proximity of the voices,had arisen from the ground, struck a match to light a cigarette.The flame showed a bronzed, black-whiskered face, a pair of eyesgazing straight; then, rearranging his wrappings, he sank fulllength and laid his head again on the saddle."That's our camp-master, whom I must send back to Sulaco now weare going to carry our survey into the Sta. Marta Valley," saidthe engineer. "A most useful fellow, lent me by Captain Mitchellof the O.S.N.  Company. It was very good of Mitchell. CharlesGould told me I couldn't do better than take advantage of theoffer. He seems to know how to rule all these muleteers andpeons. We had not the slightest trouble with our people. He shallescort your diligencia right into Sulaco with some of our railwaypeons. The road is bad. To have him at hand may save you an upsetor two. He promised me to take care of your person all the waydown as if you were his father."This camp-master was the Italian sailor whom all the Europeans inSulaco, following Captain Mitchell's mispronunciation, were inthe habit of calling Nostromo.  And indeed, taciturn and ready,he did take excellent care of his charge at the bad parts of theroad, as Sir John himself acknowledged to Mrs. Gould afterwards.CHAPTER SIXAT THAT time Nostromo had been already long enough in the countryto raise to the highest pitch Captain Mitchell's opinion of theextraordinary value of his discovery. Clearly he was one of thoseinvaluable subordinates whom to possess is a legitimate cause ofboasting. Captain Mitchell plumed himself upon his eye formen--but he was not selfish--and in the innocence of his pridewas already developing that mania for "lending you my Capataz deCargadores" which was to bring Nostromo into personal contact,sooner or later, with every European in Sulaco, as a sort ofuniversal factotum--a prodigy of efficiency in his own sphere oflife."The fellow is devoted to me, body and soul!" Captain Mitchellwas given to affirm; and though nobody, perhaps, could haveexplained why it should be so, it was impossible on a survey oftheir relation to throw doubt on that statement, unless, indeed,one were a bitter, eccentric character like Dr. Monygham--forinstance--whose short, hopeless laugh expressed somehow animmense mistrust of mankind. Not that Dr. Monygham was a prodigaleither of laughter or of words. He was bitterly taciturn when athis best. At his worst people feared the open scornfulness of histongue. Only Mrs. Gould could keep his unbelief in men's motiveswithin due bounds; but even to her (on an occasion not connectedwith Nostromo, and in a tone which for him was gentle), even toher, he had said once, "Really, it is most unreasonable to demandthat a man should think of other people so much better than he isable to think of himself."And Mrs. Gould had hastened to drop the subject.  There werestrange rumours of the English doctor.  Years ago, in the time ofGuzman Bento, he had been mixed up, it was whispered, in aconspiracy which was betrayed and, as people expressed it,drowned in blood.  His hair had turned grey, his hairless, seamedface was of a brick-dust colour; the large check pattern of hisflannel shirt and his old stained Panama hat were an establisheddefiance to the conventionalities of Sulaco.  Had it not been forthe immaculate cleanliness of his apparel he might have beentaken for one of those shiftless Europeans that are a moraleyesore to the respectability of a foreign colony in almost everyexotic part of the world. The young ladies of Sulaco, adorningwith clusters of pretty faces the balconies along the Street ofthe Constitution, when they saw him pass, with his limping gaitand bowed head, a short linen jacket drawn on carelessly over theflannel check shirt, would remark to each other, "Here is theSenor doctor going to call on Dona Emilia. He has got his littlecoat on." The inference was true. Its deeper meaning was hiddenfrom their simple intelligence. Moreover, they expended no storeof thought on the doctor. He was old, ugly, learned--and a little"loco"--mad, if not a bit of a sorcerer, as the common peoplesuspected him of being. The little white jacket was in reality aconcession to Mrs. Gould's humanizing influence. The doctor, withhis habit of sceptical, bitter speech, had no other means ofshowing his profound respect for the character of the woman whowas known in the country as the English Senora. He presented thistribute very seriously indeed; it was no trifle for a man of hishabits. Mrs. Gould felt that, too, perfectly.  She would neverhave thought of imposing upon him this marked show of deference.She kept her old Spanish house (one of the finest specimens inSulaco) open for the dispensation of the small graces ofexistence. She dispensed them with simplicity and charm becauseshe was guided by an alert perception of values. She was highlygifted in the art of human intercourse which consists in delicateshades of self-forgetfulness and in the suggestion of universalcomprehension. Charles Gould (the Gould family, established inCostaguana for three generations, always went to England fortheir education and for their wives) imagined that he had fallenin love with a girl's sound common sense like any other man, butthese were not exactly the reasons why, for instance, the wholesurveying camp, from the youngest of the young men to theirmature chief, should have found occasion to allude to Mrs.Gould's house so frequently amongst the high peaks of the Sierra.She would have protested that she had done nothing for them, witha low laugh and a surprised widening of her grey eyes, hadanybody told her how convincingly she was remembered on the edgeof the snow-line above Sulaco. But directly, with a littlecapable air of setting her wits to work, she would have found anexplanation. "Of course, it was such a surprise for these boys tofind any sort of welcome here. And I suppose they are homesick.I suppose everybody must be always just a little homesick."She was always sorry for homesick people.Born in the country, as his father before him, spare and tall,with a flaming moustache, a neat chin, clear blue eyes, auburnhair, and a thin, fresh, red face, Charles Gould looked like anew arrival from over the sea. His grandfather had fought in thecause of independence under Bolivar, in that famous Englishlegion which on the battlefield of Carabobo had been saluted bythe great Liberator as Saviours of his country. One of CharlesGould's uncles had been the elected President of that veryprovince of Sulaco (then called a State) in the days ofFederation, and afterwards had been put up against the wall of achurch and shot by the order of the barbarous Unionist general,Guzman Bento. It was the same Guzman Bento who, becoming laterPerpetual President, famed for his ruthless and cruel tyranny,readied his apotheosis in the popular legend of a sanguinaryland-haunting spectre whose body had been carried off by thedevil in person from the brick mausoleum in the nave of theChurch of Assumption in Sta. Marta. Thus, at least, the priestsexplained its disappearance to the barefooted multitude thatstreamed in, awestruck, to gaze at the hole in the side of theugly box of bricks before the great altar.Guzman Bento of cruel memory had put to death great numbers ofpeople besides Charles Gould's uncle; but with a relativemartyred in the cause of aristocracy, the Sulaco Oligarchs (thiswas the phraseology of Guzman Bento's time; now they were calledBlancos, and had given up the federal idea), which meant thefamilies of pure Spanish descent, considered Charles as one ofthemselves. With such a family record, no one could be more of aCostaguanero than Don Carlos Gould; but his aspect was socharacteristic that in the talk of common people he was just theInglez--the Englishman of Sulaco. He looked more English than acasual tourist, a sort of heretic pilgrim, however, quite unknownin Sulaco. He looked more English than the last arrived batch ofyoung railway engineers, than anybody out of the hunting-fieldpictures in the numbers of Punch reaching his wife's drawing-roomtwo months or so after date. It astonished you to hear him talkSpanish (Castillan, as the natives say) or the Indian dialect ofthe country-people so naturally. His accent had never beenEnglish; but there was something so indelible in all theseancestral Goulds--liberators, explorers, coffee planters,merchants, revolutionists--of Costaguana, that he, the onlyrepresentative of the third generation in a continent possessingits own style of horsemanship, went on looking thoroughly Englisheven on horseback. This is not said of him in the mocking spiritof the Llaneros--men of the great plains--who think that no onein the world knows how to sit a horse but themselves. CharlesGould, to use the suitably lofty phrase, rode like a centaur.Riding for him was not a special form of exercise; it was anatural faculty, as walking straight is to all men sound of mindand limb; but, all the same, when cantering beside the ruttyox-cart track to the mine he looked in his English clothes andwith his imported saddlery as though he had come this moment toCostaguana at his easy swift pasotrote, straight out of somegreen meadow at the other side of the world.His way would lie along the old Spanish road--the Camino Real ofpopular speech--the only remaining vestige of a fact and nameleft by that royalty old Giorgio Viola hated, and whose veryshadow had departed from the land; for the big equestrian statueof Charles IV at the entrance of the Alameda, towering whiteagainst the trees, was only known to the folk from the countryand to the beggars of the town that slept on the steps around thepedestal, as the Horse of Stone. The other Carlos, turning off tothe left with a rapid clatter of hoofs on the disjointed pavement--Don Carlos Gould, in his English clothes, looked asincongruous, but much more at home than the kingly cavalierreining in his steed on the pedestal above the sleeping leperos,with his marble arm raised towards the marble rim of a plumedhat.The weather-stained effigy of the mounted king, with its vaguesuggestion of a saluting gesture, seemed to present aninscrutable breast to the political changes which had robbed itof its very name; but neither did the other horseman, well knownto the people, keen and alive on his well-shaped, slate-colouredbeast with a white eye, wear his heart on the sleeve of hisEnglish coat. His mind preserved its steady poise as if shelteredin the passionless stability of private and public decencies athome in Europe. He accepted with a like calm the shocking mannerin which the Sulaco ladies smothered their faces with pearlpowder till they looked like white plaster casts with beautifulliving eyes, the peculiar gossip of the town, and the continuouspolitical changes, the constant "saving of the country," which tohis wife seemed a puerile and bloodthirsty game of murder andrapine played with terrible earnestness by depraved children. Inthe early days of her Costaguana life, the little lady used toclench her hands with exasperation at not being able to take thepublic affairs of the country as seriously as the incidentalatrocity of methods deserved. She saw in them a comedy of naivepretences, but hardly anything genuine except her own appalledindignation. Charles, very quiet and twisting his longmoustaches, would decline to discuss them at all. Once, however,he observed to her gently--"My dear, you seem to forget that I was born here." These fewwords made her pause as if they had been a sudden revelation.Perhaps the mere fact of being born in the country did make adifference. She had a great confidence in her husband; it hadalways been very great. He had struck her imagination from thefirst by his unsentimentalism, by that very quietude of mindwhich she had erected in her thought for a sign of perfectcompetency in the business of living. Don Jose Avellanos, theirneighbour across the street, a statesman, a poet, a man ofculture, who had represented his country at several EuropeanCourts (and had suffered untold indignities as a state prisonerin the time of the tyrant Guzman Bento), used to declare in DonaEmilia's drawing-room that Carlos had all the English qualitiesof character with a truly patriotic heart.Mrs. Gould, raising her eyes to her husband's thin, red and tanface, could not detect the slightest quiver of a feature at whathe must have heard said of his patriotism. Perhaps he had justdismounted on his return from the mine; he was English enough todisregard the hottest hours of the day. Basilio, in a livery ofwhite linen and a red sash, had squatted for a moment behind hisheels to unstrap the heavy, blunt spurs in the patio; and thenthe Senor Administrator would go up the staircase into thegallery. Rows of plants in pots, ranged on the balustrade betweenthe pilasters of the arches, screened the corredor with theirleaves and flowers from the quadrangle below, whose paved spaceis the true hearthstone of a South American house, where thequiet hours of domestic life are marked by the shifting of lightand shadow on the flagstones.Senor Avellanos was in the habit of crossing the patio at fiveo'clock almost every day. Don Jose chose to come over at tea-timebecause the English rite at Dona Emilia's house reminded him ofthe time he lived in London as Minister Plenipotentiary to theCourt of St. James. He did not like tea; and, usually, rockinghis American chair, his neat little shiny boots crossed on thefoot-rest, he would talk on and on with a sort of complacentvirtuosity wonderful in a man of his age, while he held the cupin his hands for a long time. His close-cropped head wasperfectly white; his eyes coalblack.On seeing Charles Gould step into the sala he would nodprovisionally and go on to the end of the oratorial period. Onlythen he would say--"Carlos, my friend, you have ridden from San Tome in the heat ofthe day. Always the true English activity.  No? What?"He drank up all the tea at once in one draught. This performancewas invariably followed by a slight shudder and a low,involuntary "br-r-r-r," which was not covered by the hastyexclamation, "Excellent!"Then giving up the empty cup into his young friend's hand,extended with a smile, he continued to expatiate upon thepatriotic nature of the San Tome mine for the simple pleasure oftalking fluently, it seemed, while his reclining body jerkedbackwards and forwards in a rocking-chair of the sort exportedfrom the United States. The ceiling of the largest drawing-roomof the Casa Gould extended its white level far above his head.The loftiness dwarfed the mixture of heavy, straight-backedSpanish chairs of brown wood with leathern seats, and Europeanfurniture, low, and cushioned all over, like squat littlemonsters gorged to bursting with steel springs and horsehair.There were knick-knacks on little tables, mirrors let into thewall above marble consoles, square spaces of carpet under the twogroups of armchairs, each presided over by a deep sofa; smallerrugs scattered all over the floor of red tiles; three windowsfrom the ceiling down to the ground, opening on a balcony, andflanked by the perpendicular folds of the dark hangings. Thestateliness of ancient days lingered between the four high,smooth walls, tinted a delicate primrose-colour; and Mrs. Gould,with her little head and shining coils of hair, sitting in acloud of muslin and lace before a slender mahogany table,resembled a fairy posed lightly before dainty philtres dispensedout of vessels of silver and porcelain.Mrs. Gould knew the history of the San Tome mine.  Worked in theearly days mostly by means of lashes on the backs of slaves, itsyield had been paid for in its own weight of human bones. Wholetribes of Indians had perished in the exploitation; and then themine was abandoned, since with this primitive method it hadceased to make a profitable return, no matter how many corpseswere thrown into its maw. Then it became forgotten.  It wasrediscovered after the War of Independence.  An English companyobtained the right to work it, and found so rich a vein thatneither the exactions of successive governments, nor theperiodical raids of recruiting officers upon the population ofpaid miners they had created, could discourage theirperseverance.  But in the end, during the long turmoil ofpronunciamentos that followed the death of the famous GuzmanBento, the native miners, incited to revolt by the emissariessent out from the capital, had risen upon their English chiefsand murdered them to a man. The decree of confiscation whichappeared immediately afterwards in the Diario Official, publishedin Sta.  Marta, began with the words: "Justly incensed at thegrinding oppression of foreigners, actuated by sordid motives ofgain rather than by love for a country where they comeimpoverished to seek their fortunes, the mining population of SanTome, etc. . . ." and ended with the declaration: "The chief ofthe State has resolved to exercise to the full his power ofclemency.  The mine, which by every law, international, human,and divine, reverts now to the Government as national property,shall remain closed till the sword drawn for the sacred defenceof liberal principles has accomplished its mission of securingthe happiness of our beloved country."And for many years this was the last of the San Tome mine. Whatadvantage that Government had expected from the spoliation, it isimpossible to tell now.  Costaguana was made with difficulty topay a beggarly money compensation to the families of the victims,and then the matter dropped out of diplomatic despatches.  Butafterwards another Government bethought itself of that valuableasset. It was an ordinary Costaguana Government--the fourth insix years--but it judged of its opportunities sanely. Itremembered the San Tome mine with a secret conviction of itsworthlessness in their own hands, but with an ingenious insightinto the various uses a silver mine can be put to, apart from thesordid process of extracting the metal from under the ground. Thefather of Charles Gould, for a long time one of the most wealthymerchants of Costaguana, had already lost a considerable part ofhis fortune in forced loans to the successive Governments. He wasa man of calm judgment, who never dreamed of pressing his claims;and when, suddenly, the perpetual concession of the San Tome minewas offered to him in full settlement, his alarm became extreme.He was versed in the ways of Governments. Indeed, the intentionof this affair, though no doubt deeply meditated in the closet,lay open on the surface of the document presented urgently forhis signature. The third and most important clause stipulatedthat the concession-holder should pay at once to the Governmentfive years' royalties on the estimated output of the mine.Mr. Gould, senior, defended himself from this fatal favour withmany arguments and entreaties, but without success. He knewnothing of mining; he had no means to put his concession on theEuropean market; the mine as a working concern did not exist. Thebuildings had been burnt down, the mining plant had beendestroyed, the mining population had disappeared from theneighbourhood years and years ago; the very road had vanishedunder a flood of tropical vegetation as effectually as ifswallowed by the sea; and the main gallery had fallen in within ahundred yards from the entrance. It was no longer an abandonedmine; it was a wild, inaccessible, and rocky gorge of the Sierra,where vestiges of charred timber, some heaps of smashed bricks,and a few shapeless pieces of rusty iron could have been foundunder the matted mass of thorny creepers covering the ground. Mr.Gould, senior, did not desire the perpetual possession of thatdesolate locality; in fact, the mere vision of it arising beforehis mind in the still watches of the night had the power toexasperate him into hours of hot and agitated insomnia.It so happened, however, that the Finance Minister of the timewas a man to whom, in years gone by, Mr.  Gould had,unfortunately, declined to grant some small pecuniary assistance,basing his refusal on the ground that the applicant was anotorious gambler and cheat, besides being more than halfsuspected of a robbery with violence on a wealthy ranchero in aremote country district, where he was actually exercising thefunction of a judge. Now, after reaching his exalted position,that politician had proclaimed his intention to repay evil withgood to Senor Gould--the poor man. He affirmed and reaffirmedthis resolution in the drawing-rooms of Sta. Marta, in a soft andimplacable voice, and with such malicious glances that Mr.Gould's best friends advised him earnestly to attempt no briberyto get the matter dropped. It would have been useless.  Indeed,it would not have been a very safe proceeding.  Such was also theopinion of a stout, loud-voiced lady of French extraction, thedaughter, she said, of an officer of high rank (officiersuperieur de l'armee), who was accommodated with lodgings withinthe walls of a secularized convent next door to the Ministry ofFinance. That florid person, when approached on behalf of Mr.Gould in a proper manner, and with a suitable present, shook herhead despondently. She was good-natured, and her despondency wasgenuine.  She imagined she could not take money in considerationof something she could not accomplish. The friend of Mr. Gould,charged with the delicate mission, used to say afterwards thatshe was the only honest person closely or remotely connected withthe Government he had ever met. "No go," she had said with acavalier, husky intonation which was natural to her, and usingturns of expression more suitable to a child of parents unknownthan to the orphaned daughter of a general officer. "No; it's nogo. Pas moyen, mon garcon.  C'est dommage, tout de meme. Ah! zut!Je ne vole pas mon monde. Je ne suis pas ministre--moi! Vouspouvez emporter votre petit sac."For a moment, biting her carmine lip, she deplored inwardly thetyranny of the rigid principles governing the sale of herinfluence in high places. Then, significantly, and with a touchof impatience, "Allez," she added, "et dites bien a votrebonhomme--entendez-vous?--qu'il faut avaler la pilule."After such a warning there was nothing for it but to sign andpay. Mr. Gould had swallowed the pill, and it was as though ithad been compounded of some subtle poison that acted directly onhis brain. He became at once mine-ridden, and as he was well readin light literature it took to his mind the form of the Old Manof the Sea fastened upon his shoulders. He also began to dream ofvampires. Mr. Gould exaggerated to himself the disadvantages ofhis new position, because he viewed it emotionally. His positionin Costaguana was no worse than before. But man is a desperatelyconservative creature, and the extravagant novelty of thisoutrage upon his purse distressed his sensibilities.  Everybodyaround him was being robbed by the grotesque and murderous bandsthat played their game of governments and revolutions after thedeath of Guzman Bento. His experience had taught him that,however short the plunder might fall of their legitimateexpectations, no gang in possession of the Presidential Palacewould be so incompetent as to suffer itself to be baffled by thewant of a pretext. The first casual colonel of the barefootedarmy of scarecrows that came along was able to expose with forceand precision to any mere civilian his titles to a sum of 10,000dollars; the while his hope would be immutably fixed upon agratuity, at any rate, of no less than a thousand. Mr.  Gouldknew that very well, and, armed with resignation, had waited forbetter times. But to be robbed under the forms of legality andbusiness was intolerable to his imagination. Mr. Gould, thefather, had one fault in his sagacious and honourable character:he attached too much importance to form. It is a failing commonto mankind, whose views are tinged by prejudices.  There was forhim in that affair a malignancy of perverted justice which, bymeans of a moral shock, attacked his vigorous physique. "It willend by killing me," he used to affirm many times a day. And, infact, since that time he began to suffer from fever, from liverpains, and mostly from a worrying inability to think of anythingelse. The Finance Minister could have formed no conception of theprofound subtlety of his revenge. Even Mr. Gould's letters to hisfourteen-year-old boy Charles, then away in England for hiseducation, came at last to talk of practically nothing but themine. He groaned over the injustice, the persecution, the outrageof that mine; he occupied whole pages in the exposition of thefatal consequences attaching to the possession of that mine fromevery point of view, with every dismal inference, with words ofhorror at the apparently eternal character of that curse. For theConcession had been granted to him and his descendants for ever.He implored his son never to return to Costaguana, never to claimany part of his inheritance there, because it was tainted by theinfamous Concession; never to touch it, never to approach it, toforget that America existed, and pursue a mercantile career inEurope. And each letter ended with bitter self-reproaches forhaving stayed too long in that cavern of thieves, intriguers, andbrigands.To be told repeatedly that one's future is blighted because ofthe possession of a silver mine is not, at the age of fourteen, amatter of prime importance as to its main statement; but in itsform it is calculated to excite a certain amount of wonder andattention. In course of time the boy, at first only puzzled bythe angry jeremiads, but rather sorry for his dad, began to turnthe matter over in his mind in such moments as he could sparefrom play and study. In about a year he had evolved from thelecture of the letters a definite conviction that there was asilver mine in the Sulaco province of the Republic of Costaguana,where poor Uncle Harry had been shot by soldiers a great manyyears before. There was also connected closely with that mine athing called the "iniquitous Gould Concession," apparentlywritten on a paper which his father desired ardently to "tear andfling into the faces" of presidents, members of judicature, andministers of State. And this desire persisted, though the namesof these people, he noticed, seldom remained the same for a wholeyear together. This desire (since the thing was iniquitous)seemed quite natural to the boy, though why the affair wasiniquitous he did not know. Afterwards, with advancing wisdom, hemanaged to clear the plain truth of the business from thefantastic intrusions of the Old Man of the Sea, vampires, andghouls, which had lent to his father's correspondence the flavourof a gruesome Arabian Nights tale.  In the end, the growing youthattained to as close an intimacy with the San Tome mine as theold man who wrote these plaintive and enraged letters on theother side of the sea. He had been made several times already topay heavy fines for neglecting to work the mine, he reported,besides other sums extracted from him on account of futureroyalties, on the ground that a man with such a valuableconcession in his pocket could not refuse his financialassistance to the Government of the Republic. The last of hisfortune was passing away from him against worthless receipts, hewrote, in a rage, whilst he was being pointed out as anindividual who had known how to secure enormous advantages fromthe necessities of his country. And the young man in Europe grewmore and more interested in that thing which could provoke such atumult of words and passion.He thought of it every day; but he thought of it withoutbitterness. It might have been an unfortunate affair for his poordad, and the whole story threw a queer light upon the social andpolitical life of Costaguana.  The view he took of it wassympathetic to his father, yet calm and reflective. His personalfeelings had not been outraged, and it is difficult to resentwith proper and durable indignation the physical or mentalanguish of another organism, even if that other organism is one'sown father. By the time he was twenty Charles Gould had, in histurn, fallen under the spell of the San Tome mine. But it wasanother form of enchantment, more suitable to his youth, intowhose magic formula there entered hope, vigour, andself-confidence, instead of weary indignation and despair.  Leftafter he was twenty to his own guidance (except for the severeinjunction not to return to Costaguana), he had pursued hisstudies in Belgium and France with the idea of qualifying for amining engineer. But this scientific aspect of his laboursremained vague and imperfect in his mind. Mines had acquired forhim a dramatic interest. He studied their peculiarities from apersonal point of view, too, as one would study the variedcharacters of men.   He visited them as one goes with curiosityto call upon remarkable persons.  He visited mines in Germany, inSpain, in Cornwall.  Abandoned workings had for him strongfascination.  Their desolation appealed to him like the sight ofhuman misery, whose causes are varied and profound.  They mighthave been worthless, but also they might have been misunderstood.His future wife was the first, and perhaps the only person todetect this secret mood which governed the profoundly sensible,almost voiceless attitude of this man towards the world ofmaterial things. And at once her delight in him, lingering withhalf-open wings like those birds that cannot rise easily from aflat level, found a pinnacle from which to soar up into theskies.They had become acquainted in Italy, where the future Mrs. Gouldwas staying with an old and pale aunt who, years before, hadmarried a middle-aged, impoverished Italian marquis. She nowmourned that man, who had known how to give up his life to theindependence and unity of his country, who had known how to be asenthusiastic in his generosity as the youngest of those who fellfor that very cause of which old Giorgio Viola was a driftingrelic, as a broken spar is suffered to float away disregardedafter a naval victory.  The Marchesa led a still, whisperingexistence, nun-like in her black robes and a white band over theforehead, in a corner of the first floor of an ancient andruinous palace, whose big, empty halls downstairs sheltered undertheir painted ceilings the harvests, the fowls, and even thecattle, together with the whole family of the tenant farmer.The two young people had met in Lucca. After that meeting CharlesGould visited no mines, though they went together in a carriage,once, to see some marble quarries, where the work resembledmining in so far that it also was the tearing of the raw materialof treasure from the earth. Charles Gould did not open his heartto her in any set speeches. He simply went on acting and thinkingin her sight. This is the true method of sincerity. One of hisfrequent remarks was, "I think sometimes that poor father takes awrong view of that San Tome business." And they discussed thatopinion long and earnestly, as if they could influence a mindacross half the globe; but in reality they discussed it becausethe sentiment of love can enter into any subject and liveardently in remote phrases. For this natural reason thesediscussions were precious to Mrs. Gould in her engaged state.Charles feared that Mr. Gould, senior, was wasting his strengthand making himself ill by his efforts to get rid of theConcession. "I fancy that this is not the kind of handling itrequires," he mused aloud, as if to himself.  And when shewondered frankly that a man of character should devote hisenergies to plotting and intrigues, Charles would remark, with agentle concern that understood her wonder, "You must not forgetthat he was born there."She would set her quick mind to work upon that, and then make theinconsequent retort, which he accepted as perfectly sagacious,because, in fact, it was so--"Well, and you? You were born there, too."He knew his answer."That's different. I've been away ten years. Dad never had such along spell; and it was more than thirty years ago."She was the first person to whom he opened his lips afterreceiving the news of his father's death."It has killed him!" he said.He had walked straight out of town with the news, straight outbefore him in the noonday sun on the white road, and his feet hadbrought him face to face with her in the hall of the ruinedpalazzo, a room magnificent and naked, with here and there a longstrip of damask, black with damp and age, hanging down on a barepanel of the wall. It was furnished with exactly one giltarmchair, with a broken back, and an octagon columnar standbearing a heavy marble vase ornamented with sculptured masks andgarlands of flowers, and cracked from top to bottom. CharlesGould was dusty with the white dust of the road lying on hisboots, on his shoulders, on his cap with two peaks. Water drippedfrom under it all over his face, and he grasped a thick oakencudgel in his bare right hand.She went very pale under the roses of her big straw hat, gloved,swinging a clear sunshade, caught just as she was going out tomeet him at the bottom of the hill, where three poplars standnear the wall of a vineyard."It has killed him!" he repeated. "He ought to have had manyyears yet. We are a long-lived family."She was too startled to say anything; he was contemplating with apenetrating and motionless stare the cracked marble urn as thoughhe had resolved to fix its shape for ever in his memory. It wasonly when, turning suddenly to her, he blurted out twice, "I'vecome to you--I've come straight to you--," without being able tofinish his phrase, that the great pitifulness of that lonely andtormented death in Costaguana came to her with the full force ofits misery. He caught hold of her hand, raised it to his lips,and at that she dropped her parasol to pat him on the cheek,murmured "Poor boy," and began to dry her eyes under the downwardcurve of her hat-brim, very small in her simple, white frock,almost like a lost child crying in the degraded grandeur of thenoble hall, while he stood by her, again perfectly motionless inthe contemplation of the marble urn.Afterwards they went out for a long walk, which was silent tillhe exclaimed suddenly--"Yes. But if he had only grappled with it in a proper way!"And then they stopped. Everywhere there were long shadows lyingon the hills, on the roads, on the enclosed fields of olivetrees; the shadows of poplars, of wide chestnuts, of farmbuildings, of stone walls; and in mid-air the sound of a bell,thin and alert, was like the throbbing pulse of the sunset glow.Her lips were slightly parted as though in surprise that heshould not be looking at her with his usual expression. His usualexpression was unconditionally approving and attentive.  He wasin his talks with her the most anxious and deferential ofdictators, an attitude that pleased her immensely. It affirmedher power without detracting from his dignity. That slight girl,with her little feet, little hands, little face attractivelyoverweighted by great coils of hair; with a rather large mouth,whose mere parting seemed to breathe upon you the fragrance offrankness and generosity, had the fastidious soul of anexperienced woman. She was, before all things and all flatteries,careful of her pride in the object of her choice. But now he wasactually not looking at her at all; and his expression was tenseand irrational, as is natural in a man who elects to stare atnothing past a young girl's head."Well, yes. It was iniquitous. They corrupted him thoroughly, thepoor old boy. Oh! why wouldn't he let me go back to him? But nowI shall know how to grapple with this."After pronouncing these words with immense assurance, he glanceddown at her, and at once fell a prey to distress, incertitude,and fear.The only thing he wanted to know now, he said, was whether shedid love him enough--whether she would have the courage to gowith him so far away? He put these questions to her in a voicethat trembled with anxiety--for he was a determined man.She did. She would. And immediately the future hostess of all theEuropeans in Sulaco had the physical experience of the earthfalling away from under her. It vanished completely, even to thevery sound of the bell.  When her feet touched the ground again,the bell was still ringing in the valley; she put her hands up toher hair, breathing quickly, and glanced up and down the stonylane. It was reassuringly empty. Meantime, Charles, stepping withone foot into a dry and dusty ditch, picked up the open parasol,which had bounded away from them with a martial sound of drumtaps.  He handed it to her soberly, a little crestfallen.They turned back, and after she had slipped her hand on his arm,the first words he pronounced were--"It's lucky that we shall be able to settle in a coast town.You've heard its name. It is Sulaco. I am so glad poor father didget that house. He bought a big house there years ago, in orderthat there should always be a Casa Gould in the principal town ofwhat used to be called the Occidental Province. I lived thereonce, as a small boy, with my dear mother, for a whole year,while poor father was away in the United States on business.  Youshall be the new mistress of the Casa Gould."And later, in the inhabited corner of the Palazzo above thevineyards, the marble hills, the pines and olives of Lucca, healso said--"The name of Gould has been always highly respected in Sulaco. Myuncle Harry was chief of the State for some time, and has left agreat name amongst the first families. By this I mean the pureCreole families, who take no part in the miserable farce ofgovernments. Uncle Harry was no adventurer. In Costaguana weGoulds are no adventurers. He was of the country, and he lovedit, but he remained essentially an Englishman in his ideas. Hemade use of the political cry of his time. It was Federation. Buthe was no politician. He simply stood up for social order out ofpure love for rational liberty and from his hate of oppression.There was no nonsense about him. He went to work in his own waybecause it seemed right, just as I feel I must lay hold of thatmine."In such words he talked to her because his memory was very fullof the country of his childhood, his heart of his life with thatgirl, and his mind of the San Tome Concession. He added that hewould have to leave her for a few days to find an American, a manfrom San Francisco, who was still somewhere in Europe. A fewmonths before he had made his acquaintance in an old historicGerman town, situated in a mining district.  The American had hiswomankind with him, but seemed lonely while they were sketchingall day long the old doorways and the turreted corners of themediaeval houses. Charles Gould had with him the inseparablecompanionship of the mine. The other man was interested in miningenterprises, knew something of Costaguana, and was no stranger tothe name of Gould.  They had talked together with some intimacywhich was made possible by the difference of their ages. Charleswanted now to find that capitalist of shrewd mind and accessiblecharacter. His father's fortune in Costaguana, which he hadsupposed to be still considerable, seemed to have melted in therascally crucible of revolutions. Apart from some ten thousandpounds deposited in England, there appeared to be nothing leftexcept the house in Sulaco, a vague right of forest exploitationin a remote and savage district, and the San Tome Concession,which had attended his poor father to the very brink of thegrave.He explained those things. It was late when they parted. She hadnever before given him such a fascinating vision of herself. Allthe eagerness of youth for a strange life, for great distances,for a future in which there was an air of adventure, of combat--asubtle thought of redress and conquest, had filled her with anintense excitement, which she returned to the giver with a moreopen and exquisite display of tenderness.He left her to walk down the hill, and directly he found himselfalone he became sober. That irreparable change a death makes inthe course of our daily thoughts can be felt in a vague andpoignant discomfort of mind.  It hurt Charles Gould to feel thatnever more, by no effort of will, would he be able to think ofhis father in the same way he used to think of him when the poorman was alive. His breathing image was no longer in his power.This consideration, closely affecting his own identity, filledhis breast with a mournful and angry desire for action. In thishis instinct was unerring.  Action is consolatory. It is theenemy of thought and the friend of flattering illusions. Only inthe conduct of our action can we find the sense of mastery overthe Fates. For his action, the mine was obviously the only field.It was imperative sometimes to know how to disobey the solemnwishes of the dead. He resolved firmly to make his disobedienceas thorough (by way of atonement) as it well could be. The minehad been the cause of an absurd moral disaster; its working mustbe made a serious and moral success. He owed it to the dead man'smemory. Such were the--properly speaking--emotions of CharlesGould. His thoughts ran upon the means of raising a large amountof capital in San Francisco or elsewhere; and incidentally thereoccurred to him also the general reflection that the counsel ofthe departed must be an unsound guide.  Not one of them could beaware beforehand what enormous changes the death of any givenindividual may produce in the very aspect of the world.The latest phase in the history of the mine Mrs.  Gould knew frompersonal experience. It was in essence the history of her marriedlife. The mantle of the Goulds' hereditary position in Sulaco haddescended amply upon her little person; but she would not allowthe peculiarities of the strange garment to weigh down thevivacity of her character, which was the sign of no meremechanical sprightliness, but of an eager intelligence.  It mustnot be supposed that Mrs. Gould's mind was masculine. A womanwith a masculine mind is not a being of superior efficiency; sheis simply a phenomenon of imperfectdifferentiation--interestingly barren and without importance.Dona Emilia's intelligence being feminine led her to achieve theconquest of Sulaco, simply by lighting the way for herunselfishness and sympathy. She could converse charmingly, butshe was not talkative. The wisdom of the heart having no concernwith the erection or demolition of theories any more than withthe defence of prejudices, has no random words at its command.The words it pronounces have the value of acts of integrity,tolerance, and compassion. A woman's true tenderness, like thetrue virility of man, is expressed in action of a conqueringkind. The ladies of Sulaco adored Mrs. Gould. "They still lookupon me as something of a monster," Mrs. Gould had saidpleasantly to one of the three gentlemen from San Francisco shehad to entertain in her new Sulaco house just about a year afterher marriage.They were her first visitors from abroad, and they had come tolook at the San Tome mine. She jested most agreeably, theythought; and Charles Gould, besides knowing thoroughly what hewas about, had shown himself a real hustler. These facts causedthem to be well disposed towards his wife. An unmistakableenthusiasm, pointed by a slight flavour of irony, made her talkof the mine absolutely fascinating to her visitors, and provokedthem to grave and indulgent smiles in which there was a good dealof deference.  Perhaps had they known how much she was inspiredby an idealistic view of success they would have been amazed atthe state of her mind as the Spanish-American ladies had beenamazed at the tireless activity of her body. She would--in herown words--have been for them "something of a monster." However,the Goulds were in essentials a reticent couple, and their guestsdeparted without the suspicion of any other purpose but simpleprofit in the working of a silver mine.  Mrs. Gould had out herown carriage, with two white mules, to drive them down to theharbour, whence the Ceres was to carry them off into the Olympusof plutocrats.  Captain Mitchell had snatched at the occasion ofleave-taking to remark to Mrs. Gould, in a low, confidentialmutter, "This marks an epoch."Mrs. Gould loved the patio of her Spanish house. A broad flightof stone steps was overlooked silently from a niche in the wallby a Madonna in blue robes with the crowned child sitting on herarm. Subdued voices ascended in the early mornings from the pavedwell of the quadrangle, with the stamping of horses and mules ledout in pairs to drink at the cistern. A tangle of slender bamboostems drooped its narrow, blade-like leaves over the square poolof water, and the fat coachman sat muffled up on the edge,holding lazily the ends of halters in his hand. Barefootedservants passed to and fro, issuing from dark, low doorwaysbelow; two laundry girls with baskets of washed linen; the bakerwith the tray of bread made for the day; Leonarda--her owncamerista--bearing high up, swung from her hand raised above herraven black head, a bunch of starched under-skirts dazzlinglywhite in the slant of sunshine. Then the old porter would hobblein, sweeping the flagstones, and the house was ready for the day.All the lofty rooms on three sides of the quadrangle opened intoeach other and into the corredor, with its wrought-iron railingsand a border of flowers, whence, like the lady of the mediaevalcastle, she could witness from above all the departures andarrivals of the Casa, to which the sonorous arched gateway lentan air of stately importance.She had watched her carriage roll away with the three guests fromthe north. She smiled. Their three arms went up simultaneously totheir three hats. Captain Mitchell, the fourth, in attendance,had already begun a pompous discourse. Then she lingered. Shelingered, approaching her face to the clusters of flowers hereand there as if to give time to her thoughts to catch up with herslow footsteps along the straight vista of the corredor.A fringed Indian hammock from Aroa, gay with colouredfeatherwork, had been swung judiciously in a corner that caughtthe early sun; for the mornings are cool in Sulaco. The clusterof flor de noche buena blazed in great masses before the openglass doors of the reception rooms. A big green parrot, brilliantlike an emerald in a cage that flashed like gold, screamed outferociously, "Viva Costaguana!" then called twice mellifluously,"Leonarda! Leonarda!" in imitation of Mrs. Gould's voice, andsuddenly took refuge in immobility and silence. Mrs. Gouldreached the end of the gallery and put her head through the doorof her husband's room.Charles Gould, with one foot on a low wooden stool, was alreadystrapping his spurs. He wanted to hurry back to the mine. Mrs.Gould, without coming in, glanced about the room. One tall, broadbookcase, with glass doors, was full of books; but in the other,without shelves, and lined with red baize, were arrangedfirearms: Winchester carbines, revolvers, a couple of shot-guns,and even two pairs of double-barrelled holster pistols. Betweenthem, by itself, upon a strip of scarlet velvet, hung an oldcavalry sabre, once the property of Don Enrique Gould, the heroof the Occidental Province, presented by Don Jose Avellanos, thehereditary friend of the family.Otherwise, the plastered white walls were completely bare, exceptfor a water-colour sketch of the San Tome mountain--the work ofDona Emilia herself. In the middle of the red-tiled floor stoodtwo long tables littered with plans and papers, a few chairs, anda glass show-case containing specimens of ore from the mine.Mrs. Gould, looking at all these things in turn, wondered aloudwhy the talk of these wealthy and enterprising men discussing theprospects, the working, and the safety of the mine rendered herso impatient and uneasy, whereas she could talk of the mine bythe hour with her husband with unwearied interest andsatisfaction.  And dropping her eyelids expressively, she added--"What do you feel about it, Charley?"Then, surprised at her husband's silence, she raised her eyes,opened wide, as pretty as pale flowers. He had done with thespurs, and, twisting his moustache with both hands, horizontally,he contemplated her from the height of his long legs with avisible appreciation of her appearance. The consciousness ofbeing thus contemplated pleased Mrs. Gould."They are considerable men," he said."I know. But have you listened to their conversation?  They don'tseem to have understood anything they have seen here.""They have seen the mine. They have understood that to somepurpose," Charles Gould interjected, in defence of the visitors;and then his wife mentioned the name of the most considerable ofthe three. He was considerable in finance and in industry. Hisname was familiar to many millions of people. He was soconsiderable that he would never have travelled so far away fromthe centre of his activity if the doctors had not insisted, withveiled menaces, on his taking a long holiday."Mr. Holroyd's sense of religion," Mrs. Gould pursued, "wasshocked and disgusted at the tawdriness of the dressed-up saintsin the cathedral--the worship, he called it, of wood and tinsel.But it seemed to me that he looked upon his own God as a sort ofinfluential partner, who gets his share of profits in theendowment of churches. That's a sort of idolatry. He told me heendowed churches every year, Charley.""No end of them," said Mr. Gould, marvelling inwardly at themobility of her physiognomy. "All over the country. He's famousfor that sort of munificence." "Oh, he didn't boast," Mrs. Goulddeclared, scrupulously.  "I believe he's really a good man, butso stupid!  A poor Chulo who offers a little silver arm or leg tothank his god for a cure is as rational and more touching.""He's at the head of immense silver and iron interests," CharlesGould observed."Ah, yes! The religion of silver and iron. He's a very civil man,though he looked awfully solemn when he first saw the Madonna onthe staircase, who's only wood and paint; but he said nothing tome. My dear Charley, I heard those men talk among themselves.Can it be that they really wish to become, for an immenseconsideration, drawers of water and hewers of wood to all thecountries and nations of the earth?""A man must work to some end," Charles Gould said, vaguely.Mrs. Gould, frowning, surveyed him from head to foot. With hisriding breeches, leather leggings (an article of apparel neverbefore seen in Costaguana), a Norfolk coat of grey flannel, andthose great flaming moustaches, he suggested an officer ofcavalry turned gentleman farmer. This combination was gratifyingto Mrs. Gould's tastes. "How thin the poor boy is!" she thought."He overworks himself." But there was no denying that hisfine-drawn, keen red face, and his whole, long-limbed, lankperson had an air of breeding and distinction. And Mrs. Gouldrelented."I only wondered what you felt," she murmured, gently.During the last few days, as it happened, Charles Gould had beenkept too busy thinking twice before he spoke to have paid muchattention to the state of his feelings. But theirs was asuccessful match, and he had no difficulty in finding his answer."The best of my feelings are in your keeping, my dear," he said,lightly; and there was so much truth in that obscure phrase thathe experienced towards her at the moment a great increase ofgratitude and tenderness.Mrs. Gould, however, did not seem to find this answer in theleast obscure. She brightened up delicately; already he hadchanged his tone."But there are facts. The worth of the mine--as a mine--is beyonddoubt. It shall make us very wealthy.  The mere working of it isa matter of technical knowledge, which I have--which ten thousandother men in the world have. But its safety, its continuedexistence as an enterprise, giving a return to men--to strangers,comparative strangers--who invest money in it, is left altogetherin my hands. I have inspired confidence in a man of wealth andposition. You seem to think this perfectly natural--do you? Well,I don't know. I don't know why I have; but it is a fact. Thisfact makes everything possible, because without it I would neverhave thought of disregarding my father's wishes.  I would neverhave disposed of the Concession as a speculator disposes of avaluable right to a company--for cash and shares, to grow richeventually if possible, but at any rate to put some money at oncein his pocket.  No. Even if it had been feasible--which Idoubt--I would not have done so. Poor father did not understand.He was afraid I would hang on to the ruinous thing, waiting forjust some such chance, and waste my life miserably. That was thetrue sense of his prohibition, which we have deliberately setaside."They were walking up and down the corredor. Her head just reachedto his shoulder. His arm, extended downwards, was about herwaist. His spurs jingled slightly."He had not seen me for ten years. He did not know me. He partedfrom me for my sake, and he would never let me come back. He wasalways talking in his letters of leaving Costaguana, ofabandoning everything and making his escape. But he was toovaluable a prey. They would have thrown him into one of theirprisons at the first suspicion."His spurred feet clinked slowly. He was bending over his wife asthey walked. The big parrot, turning its head askew, followedtheir pacing figures with a round, unblinking eye."He was a lonely man. Ever since I was ten years old he used totalk to me as if I had been grown up.  When I was in Europe hewrote to me every month.  Ten, twelve pages every month of mylife for ten years.  And, after all, he did not know me! Justthink of it--ten whole years away; the years I was growing upinto a man. He could not know me. Do you think he could?"Mrs. Gould shook her head negatively; which was just what herhusband had expected from the strength of the argument. But sheshook her head negatively only because she thought that no onecould know her Charles--really know him for what he was butherself. The thing was obvious. It could be felt. It required noargument. And poor Mr. Gould, senior, who had died too soon toever hear of their engagement, remained too shadowy a figure forher to be credited with knowledge of any sort whatever."No, he did not understand. In my view this mine could never havebeen a thing to sell. Never! After all his misery I simply couldnot have touched it for money alone," Charles Gould pursued: andshe pressed her head to his shoulder approvingly.These two young people remembered the life which had endedwretchedly just when their own lives had come together in thatsplendour of hopeful love, which to the most sensible mindsappears like a triumph of good over all the evils of the earth. Avague idea of rehabilitation had entered the plan of their life.That it was so vague as to elude the support of argument made itonly the stronger. It had presented itself to them at the instantwhen the woman's instinct of devotion and the man's instinct ofactivity receive from the strongest of illusions their mostpowerful impulse.  The very prohibition imposed the necessity ofsuccess.  It was as if they had been morally bound to make goodtheir vigorous view of life against the unnatural error ofweariness and despair. If the idea of wealth was present to themit was only in so far as it was bound with that other success.Mrs. Gould, an orphan from early childhood and without fortune,brought up in an atmosphere of intellectual interests, had neverconsidered the aspects of great wealth. They were too remote, andshe had not learned that they were desirable.  On the other hand,she had not known anything of absolute want. Even the verypoverty of her aunt, the Marchesa, had nothing intolerable to arefined mind; it seemed in accord with a great grief: it had theausterity of a sacrifice offered to a noble ideal.  Thus even themost legitimate touch of materialism was wanting in Mrs. Gould'scharacter. The dead man of whom she thought with tenderness(because he was Charley's father) and with some impatience(because he had been weak), must be put completely in the wrong.Nothing else would do to keep their prosperity without a stain onits only real, on its immaterial side!Charles Gould, on his part, had been obliged to keep the idea ofwealth well to the fore; but he brought it forward as a means,not as an end. Unless the mine was good business it could not betouched. He had to insist on that aspect of the enterprise. Itwas his lever to move men who had capital. And Charles Gouldbelieved in the mine. He knew everything that could be known ofit. His faith in the mine was contagious, though it was notserved by a great eloquence; but business men are frequently assanguine and imaginative as lovers. They are affected by apersonality much oftener than people would suppose; and CharlesGould, in his unshaken assurance, was absolutely convincing.Besides, it was a matter of common knowledge to the men to whomhe addressed himself that mining in Costaguana was a game thatcould be made considably more than worth the candle. The men ofaffairs knew that very well. The real difficulty in touching itwas elsewhere. Against that there was an implication of calm andimplacable resolution in Charles Gould's very voice. Men ofaffairs venture sometimes on acts that the common judgment of theworld would pronounce absurd; they make their decisions onapparently impulsive and human grounds. "Very well," had said theconsiderable personage to whom Charles Gould on his way outthrough San Francisco had lucidly exposed his point of view. "Letus suppose that the mining affairs of Sulaco are taken in hand.There would then be in it: first, the house of Holroyd, which isall right; then, Mr. Charles Gould, a citizen of Costaguana, whois also all right; and, lastly, the Government of the Republic.So far this resembles the first start of the Atacama nitratefields, where there was a financing house, a gentleman of thename of Edwards, and--a Government; or, rather, twoGovernments--two South American Governments. And you know whatcame of it. War came of it; devastating and prolonged war came ofit, Mr. Gould. However, here we possess the advantage of havingonly one South American Government hanging around for plunder outof the deal. It is an advantage; but then there are degrees ofbadness, and that Government is the Costaguana Government."Thus spoke the considerable personage, the millionaire endower ofchurches on a scale befitting the greatness of his nativeland--the same to whom the doctors used the language of horridand veiled menaces. He was a big-limbed, deliberate man, whosequiet burliness lent to an ample silk-faced frock-coat asuperfine dignity. His hair was iron grey, his eyebrows werestill black, and his massive profile was the profile of aCaesar's head on an old Roman coin. But his parentage was Germanand Scotch and English, with remote strains of Danish and Frenchblood, giving him the temperament of a Puritan and an insatiableimagination of conquest. He was completely unbending to hisvisitor, because of the warm introduction the visitor had broughtfrom Europe, and because of an irrational liking for earnestnessand determination wherever met, to whatever end directed."The Costaguana Government shall play its hand for all it'sworth--and don't you forget it, Mr. Gould.  Now, what isCostaguana? It is the bottomless pit of 10 per cent. loans andother fool investments. European capital has been flung into itwith both hands for years. Not ours, though. We in this countryknow just about enough to keep indoors when it rains. We can sitand watch. Of course, some day we shall step in. We are bound to.But there's no hurry. Time itself has got to wait on the greatestcountry in the whole of God's Universe. We shall be giving theword for everything: industry, trade, law, journalism, art,politics, and religion, from Cape Horn clear over to Smith'sSound, and beyond, too, if anything worth taking hold of turns upat the North Pole. And then we shall have the leisure to take inhand the outlying islands and continents of the earth. We shallrun the world's business whether the world likes it or not. Theworld can't help it--and neither can we, I guess."By this he meant to express his faith in destiny in wordssuitable to his intelligence, which was unskilled in thepresentation of general ideas. His intelligence was nourished onfacts; and Charles Gould, whose imagination had been permanentlyaffected by the one great fact of a silver mine, had no objectionto this theory of the world's future. If it had seemeddistasteful for a moment it was because the sudden statement ofsuch vast eventualities dwarfed almost to nothingness the actualmatter in hand. He and his plans and all the mineral wealth ofthe Occidental Province appeared suddenly robbed of every vestigeof magnitude. The sensation was disagreeable; but Charles Gouldwas not dull. Already he felt that he was producing a favourableimpression; the consciousness of that flattering fact helped himto a vague smile, which his big interlocutor took for a smile ofdiscreet and admiring assent. He smiled quietly, too; andimmediately Charles Gould, with that mental agility mankind willdisplay in defence of a cherished hope, reflected that the veryapparent insignificance of his aim would help him to success. Hispersonality and his mine would be taken up because it was amatter of no great consequence, one way or another, to a man whoreferred his action to such a prodigious destiny. And CharlesGould was not humiliated by this consideration, because the thingremained as big as ever for him. Nobody else's vast conceptionsof destiny could diminish the aspect of his desire for theredemption of the San Tome mine. In comparison to the correctnessof his aim, definite in space and absolutely attainable within alimited time, the other man appeared for an instant as a dreamyidealist of no importance.The great man, massive and benignant, had been looking at himthoughtfully; when he broke the short silence it was to remarkthat concessions flew about thick in the air of Costaguana. Anysimple soul that just yearned to be taken in could bring down aconcession at the first shot."Our consuls get their mouths stopped with them," he continued,with a twinkle of genial scorn in his eyes.  But in a moment hebecame grave. "A conscientious, upright man, that cares nothingfor boodle, and keeps clear of their intrigues, conspiracies, andfactions, soon gets his passports. See that, Mr. Gould? Personanon grata. That's the reason our Government is never properlyinformed. On the other hand, Europe must be kept out of thiscontinent, and for proper interference on our part the time isnot yet ripe, I dare say.  But we here--we are not this country'sGovernment, neither are we simple souls. Your affair is allright.  The main question for us is whether the second partner,and that's you, is the right sort to hold his own against thethird and unwelcome partner, which is one or another of the highand mighty robber gangs that run the Costaguana Government. Whatdo you think, Mr. Gould, eh?"He bent forward to look steadily into the unflinching eyes ofCharles Gould, who, remembering the large box full of hisfather's letters, put the accumulated scorn and bitterness ofmany years into the tone of his answer--"As far as the knowledge of these men and their methods and theirpolitics is concerned, I can answer for myself. I have been fedon that sort of knowledge since I was a boy. I am not likely tofall into mistakes from excess of optimism.""Not likely, eh? That's all right. Tact and a stiff upper lip iswhat you'll want; and you could bluff a little on the strength ofyour backing. Not too much, though. We will go with you as longas the thing runs straight. But we won't be drawn into any largetrouble. This is the experiment which I am willing to make. Thereis some risk, and we will take it; but if you can't keep up yourend, we will stand our loss, of course, and then--we'll let thething go. This mine can wait; it has been shut up before, as youknow. You must understand that under no circumstances will weconsent to throw good money after bad."Thus the great personage had spoken then, in his own privateoffice, in a great city where other men (very considerable in theeyes of a vain populace) waited with alacrity upon a wave of hishand. And rather more than a year later, during his unexpectedappearance in Sulaco, he had emphasized his uncompromisingattitude with a freedom of sincerity permitted to his wealth andinfluence. He did this with the less reserve, perhaps, becausethe inspection of what had been done, and more still the way inwhich successive steps had been taken, had impressed him with theconviction that Charles Gould was perfectly capable of keeping uphis end."This young fellow," he thought to himself, "may yet become apower in the land."This thought flattered him, for hitherto the only account of thisyoung man he could give to his intimates was--"My brother-in-law met him in one of these one-horse old Germantowns, near some mines, and sent him on to me with a letter. He'sone of the Costaguana Goulds, pure-bred Englishmen, but all bornin the country. His uncle went into politics, was the lastProvincial President of Sulaco, and got shot after a battle. Hisfather was a prominent business man in Sta. Marta, tried to keepclear of their politics, and died ruined after a lot ofrevolutions. And that's your Costaguana in a nutshell."Of course, he was too great a man to be questioned as to hismotives, even by his intimates. The outside world was at libertyto wonder respectfully at the hidden meaning of his actions. Hewas so great a man that his lavish patronage of the "purer formsof Christianity" (which in its naive form of church-buildingamused Mrs. Gould) was looked upon by his fellow-citizens as themanifestation of a pious and humble spirit. But in his owncircles of the financial world the taking up of such a thing asthe San Tome mine was regarded with respect, indeed, but ratheras a subject for discreet jocularity. It was a great man'scaprice.  In the great Holroyd building (an enormous pile ofiron, glass, and blocks of stone at the corner of two streets,cobwebbed aloft by the radiation of telegraph wires) the heads ofprincipal departments exchanged humorous glances, which meantthat they were not let into the secrets of the San Tome business.The Costaguana mail (it was never large--one fairly heavyenvelope) was taken unopened straight into the great man's room,and no instructions dealing with it had ever been issued thence.The office whispered that he answered personally--and not bydictation either, but actually writing in his own hand, with penand ink, and, it was to be supposed, taking a copy in his ownprivate press copy-book, inaccessible to profane eyes.  Somescornful young men, insignificant pieces of minor machinery inthat eleven-storey-high workshop of great affairs, expressedfrankly their private opinion that the great chief had done atlast something silly, and was ashamed of his folly; others,elderly and insignificant, but full of romantic reverence for thebusiness that had devoured their best years, used to mutterdarkly and knowingly that this was a portentous sign; that theHolroyd connection meant by-and-by to get hold of the wholeRepublic of Costaguana, lock, stock, and barrel.  But, in fact,the hobby theory was the right one. It interested the great manto attend personally to the San Tome mine; it interested him somuch that he allowed this hobby to give a direction to the firstcomplete holiday he had taken for quite a startling number ofyears. He was not running a great enterprise there; no mererailway board or industrial corporation. He was running a man! Asuccess would have pleased him very much on refreshingly novelgrounds; but, on the other side of the same feeling, it wasincumbent upon him to cast it off utterly at the first sign offailure. A man may be thrown off. The papers had unfortunatelytrumpeted all over the land his journey to Costaguana.  If he waspleased at the way Charles Gould was going on, he infused anadded grimness into his assurances of support. Even at the verylast interview, half an hour or so before he rolled out of thepatio, hat in hand, behind Mrs. Gould's white mules, he had saidin Charles's room--"You go ahead in your own way, and I shall know how to help youas long as you hold your own. But you may rest assured that in agiven case we shall know how to drop you in time."To this Charles Gould's only answer had been: "You may beginsending out the machinery as soon as you like."And the great man had liked this imperturbable assurance. Thesecret of it was that to Charles Gould's mind theseuncompromising terms were agreeable.  Like this the minepreserved its identity, with which he had endowed it as a boy;and it remained dependent on himself alone. It was a seriousaffair, and he, too, took it grimly."Of course," he said to his wife, alluding to this lastconversation with the departed guest, while they walked slowly upand down the corredor, followed by the irritated eye of theparrot--"of course, a man of that sort can take up a thing ordrop it when he likes.  He will suffer from no sense of defeat.He may have to give in, or he may have to die to-morrow, but thegreat silver and iron interests will survive, and some day willget hold of Costaguana along with the rest of the world."They had stopped near the cage. The parrot, catching the sound ofa word belonging to his vocabulary, was moved to interfere.Parrots are very human."Viva Costaguana!" he shrieked, with intense self-assertion, and,instantly ruffling up his feathers, assumed an air of puffed-upsomnolence behind the glittering wires."And do you believe that, Charley?" Mrs. Gould asked. "This seemsto me most awful materialism, and--""My dear, it's nothing to me," interrupted her husband, in areasonable tone. "I make use of what I see.  What's it to mewhether his talk is the voice of destiny or simply a bit ofclap-trap eloquence? There's a good deal of eloquence of one sortor another produced in both Americas. The air of the New Worldseems favourable to the art of declamation. Have you forgottenhow dear Avellanos can hold forth for hours here--?""Oh, but that's different," protested Mrs. Gould, almost shocked.The allusion was not to the point.  Don Jose was a dear good man,who talked very well, and was enthusiastic about the greatness ofthe San Tome mine. "How can you compare them, Charles?" sheexclaimed, reproachfully. "He has suffered--and yet he hopes."The working competence of men--which she never questioned--wasvery surprising to Mrs. Gould, because upon so many obviousissues they showed themselves strangely muddle-headed.Charles Gould, with a careworn calmness which secured for him atonce his wife's anxious sympathy, assured her that he was notcomparing. He was an American himself, after all, and perhaps hecould understand both kinds of eloquence--"if it were worth whileto try," he added, grimly. But he had breathed the air of Englandlonger than any of his people had done for three generations, andreally he begged to be excused.  His poor father could beeloquent, too. And he asked his wife whether she remembered apassage in one of his father's last letters where Mr. Gould hadexpressed the conviction that "God looked wrathfully at thesecountries, or else He would let some ray of hope fall through arift in the appalling darkness of intrigue, bloodshed, and crimethat hung over the Queen of Continents."Mrs. Gould had not forgotten. "You read it to me, Charley," shemurmured. "It was a striking pronouncement.  How deeply yourfather must have felt its terrible sadness!""He did not like to be robbed. It exasperated him," said CharlesGould. "But the image will serve well enough. What is wanted hereis law, good faith, order, security. Any one can declaim aboutthese things, but I pin my faith to material interests. Only letthe material interests once get a firm footing, and they arebound to impose the conditions on which alone they can continueto exist. That's how your money-making is justified here in theface of lawlessness and disorder.  It is justified because thesecurity which it demands must be shared with an oppressedpeople. A better justice will come afterwards. That's your ray ofhope." His arm pressed her slight form closer to his side for amoment. "And who knows whether in that sense even the San Tomemine may not become that little rift in the darkness which poorfather despaired of ever seeing?"She glanced up at him with admiration. He was competent; he hadgiven a vast shape to the vagueness of her unselfish ambitions."Charley," she said, "you are splendidly disobedient."He left her suddenly in the corredor to go and get his hat, asoft, grey sombrero, an article of national costume whichcombined unexpectedly well with his English get-up. He came back,a riding-whip under his arm, buttoning up a dogskin glove; hisface reflected the resolute nature of his thoughts. His wife hadwaited for him at the head of the stairs, and before he gave herthe parting kiss he finished the conversation--"What should be perfectly clear to us," he said, "is the factthat there is no going back. Where could we begin life afresh? Weare in now for all that there is in us."He bent over her upturned face very tenderly and a littleremorsefully. Charles Gould was competent because he had noillusions. The Gould Concession had to fight for life with suchweapons as could be found at once in the mire of a corruptionthat was so universal as almost to lose its significance. He wasprepared to stoop for his weapons. For a moment he felt as if thesilver mine, which had killed his father, had decoyed him furtherthan he meant to go; and with the roundabout logic of emotions,he felt that the worthiness of his life was bound up withsuccess. There was no going back.CHAPTER SEVEN"MRS. GOULD was too intelligently sympathetic not to share thatfeeling. It made life exciting, and she was too much of a womannot to like excitement. But it frightened her, too, a little; andwhen Don Jose Avellanos, rocking in the American chair, would goso far as to say, "Even, my dear Carlos, if you had failed; evenif some untoward event were yet to destroy your work--which Godforbid!--you would have deserved well of your country," Mrs.Gould would look up from the tea-table profoundly at her unmovedhusband stirring the spoon in the cup as though he had not hearda word.Not that Don Jose anticipated anything of the sort.  He could notpraise enough dear Carlos's tact and courage. His English,rock-like quality of character was his best safeguard, Don Joseaffirmed; and, turning to Mrs. Gould, "As to you, Emilia, mysoul"--he would address her with the familiarity of his age andold friendship--"you are as true a patriot as though you had beenborn in our midst."This might have been less or more than the truth.  Mrs. Gould,accompanying her husband all over the province in the search forlabour, had seen the land with a deeper glance than a truebornCostaguanera could have done. In her travel-worn riding habit,her face powdered white like a plaster cast, with a furtherprotection of a small silk mask during the heat of the day, sherode on a well-shaped, light-footed pony in the centre of alittle cavalcade. Two mozos de campo, picturesque in great hats,with spurred bare heels, in white embroidered calzoneras, leatherjackets and striped ponchos, rode ahead with carbines acrosstheir shoulders, swaying in unison to the pace of the horses.  Atropilla of pack mules brought up the rear in charge of a thinbrown muleteer, sitting his long-eared beast very near the tail,legs thrust far forward, the wide brim of his hat set far back,making a sort of halo for his head.  An old Costaguana officer, aretired senior major of humble origin, but patronized by thefirst families on account of his Blanco opinions, had beenrecommended by Don Jose for commissary and organizer of thatexpedition. The points of his grey moustache hung far below hischin, and, riding on Mrs. Gould's left hand, he looked about withkindly eyes, pointing out the features of the country, tellingthe names of the little pueblos and of the estates, of thesmooth-walled haciendas like long fortresses crowning the knollsabove the level of the Sulaco Valley. It unrolled itself, withgreen young crops, plains, woodland, and gleams of water,park-like, from the blue vapour of the distant sierra to animmense quivering horizon of grass and sky, where big whiteclouds seemed to fall slowly into the darkness of their ownshadows.Men ploughed with wooden ploughs and yoked oxen, small on aboundless expanse, as if attacking immensity itself. The mountedfigures of vaqueros galloped in the distance, and the great herdsfed with all their horned heads one way, in one single waveringline as far as eye could reach across the broad potreros. Aspreading cotton-wool tree shaded a thatched ranche by the road;the trudging files of burdened Indians taking off their hats,would lift sad, mute eyes to the cavalcade raising the dust ofthe crumbling camino real made by the hands of their enslavedforefathers. And Mrs.  Gould, with each day's journey, seemed tocome nearer to the soul of the land in the tremendous disclosureof this interior unaffected by the slight European veneer of thecoast towns, a great land of plain and mountain and people,suffering and mute, waiting for the future in a patheticimmobility of patience.She knew its sights and its hospitality, dispensed with a sort ofslumbrous dignity in those great houses presenting long, blindwalls and heavy portals to the wind-swept pastures. She was giventhe head of the tables, where masters and dependants sat in asimple and patriarchal state. The ladies of the house would talksoftly in the moonlight under the orange trees of the courtyards,impressing upon her the sweetness of their voices and thesomething mysterious in the quietude of their lives. In themorning the gentlemen, well mounted in braided sombreros andembroidered riding suits, with much silver on the trappings oftheir horses, would ride forth to escort the departing guestsbefore committing them, with grave good-byes, to the care of Godat the boundary pillars of their estates. In all these householdsshe could hear stories of political outrage; friends, relatives,ruined, imprisoned, killed in the battles of senseless civilwars, barbarously executed in ferocious proscriptions, as thoughthe government of the country had been a struggle of lust betweenbands of absurd devils let loose upon the land with sabres anduniforms and grandiloquent phrases. And on all the lips she founda weary desire for peace, the dread of officialdom with itsnightmarish parody of administration without law, withoutsecurity, and without justice.She bore a whole two months of wandering very well; she had thatpower of resistance to fatigue which one discovers here and therein some quite frail-looking women with surprise--like a state ofpossession by a remarkably stubborn spirit. Don Pepe--the oldCostaguana major--after much display of solicitude for thedelicate lady, had ended by conferring upon her the name of the"Never-tired Senora." Mrs. Gould was indeed becoming aCostaguanera. Having acquired in Southern Europe a knowledge oftrue peasantry, she was able to appreciate the great worth of thepeople. She saw the man under the silent, sad-eyed beast ofburden.  She saw them on the road carrying loads, lonely figuresupon the plain, toiling under great straw hats, with their whiteclothing flapping about their limbs in the wind; she rememberedthe villages by some group of Indian women at the fountainimpressed upon her memory, by the face of some young Indian girlwith a melancholy and sensual profile, raising an earthenwarevessel of cool water at the door of a dark hut with a woodenporch cumbered with great brown jars. The solid wooden wheels ofan ox-cart, halted with its shafts in the dust, showed thestrokes of the axe; and a party of charcoal carriers, with eachman's load resting above his head on the top of the low mud wall,slept stretched in a row within the strip of shade.The heavy stonework of bridges and churches left by theconquerors proclaimed the disregard of human labour, thetribute-labour of vanished nations. The power of king and churchwas gone, but at the sight of some heavy ruinous pile overtoppingfrom a knoll the low mud walls of a village, Don Pepe wouldinterrupt the tale of his campaigns to exclaim--"Poor Costaguana! Before, it was everything for the Padres,nothing for the people; and now it is everything for those greatpoliticos in Sta. Marta, for negroes and thieves."Charles talked with the alcaldes, with the fiscales, with theprincipal people in towns, and with the caballeros on theestates. The commandantes of the districts offered himescorts--for he could show an authorization from the Sulacopolitical chief of the day.  How much the document had cost himin gold twenty-dollar pieces was a secret between himself, agreat man in the United States (who condescended to answer theSulaco mail with his own hand), and a great man of another sort,with a dark olive complexion and shifty eyes, inhabiting then thePalace of the Intendencia in Sulaco, and who piqued himself onhis culture and Europeanism generally in a rather French stylebecause he had lived in Europe for some years--in exile, he said.However, it was pretty well known that just before this exile hehad incautiously gambled away all the cash in the Custom House ofa small port where a friend in power had procured for him thepost of subcollector.  That youthful indiscretion had, amongstother inconveniences, obliged him to earn his living for a timeas a cafe waiter in Madrid; but his talents must have been great,after all, since they had enabled him to retrieve his politicalfortunes so splendidly.  Charles Gould, exposing his businesswith an imperturbable steadiness, called him Excellency.The provincial Excellency assumed a weary superiority, tiltinghis chair far back near an open window in the true Costaguanamanner. The military band happened to be braying operaticselections on the plaza just then, and twice he raised his handimperatively for silence in order to listen to a favouritepassage."Exquisite, delicious!" he murmured; while Charles Gould waited,standing by with inscrutable patience.  "Lucia, Lucia diLammermoor! I am passionate for music. It transports me. Ha! thedivine--ha!--Mozart. Si! divine . . . What is it you weresaying?"Of course, rumours had reached him already of the newcomer'sintentions. Besides, he had received an official warning fromSta. Marta. His manner was intended simply to conceal hiscuriosity and impress his visitor. But after he had locked upsomething valuable in the drawer of a large writing-desk in adistant part of the room, he became very affable, and walked backto his chair smartly."If you intend to build villages and assemble a population nearthe mine, you shall require a decree of the Minister of theInterior for that," he suggested in a business-like manner."I have already sent a memorial," said Charles Gould, steadily,"and I reckon now confidently upon your Excellency's favourableconclusions."The Excellency was a man of many moods. With the receipt of themoney a great mellowness had descended upon his simple soul.Unexpectedly he fetched a deep sigh."Ah, Don Carlos! What we want is advanced men like you in theprovince. The lethargy--the lethargy of these aristocrats! Thewant of public spirit! The absence of all enterprise! I, with myprofound studies in Europe, you understand--"With one hand thrust into his swelling bosom, he rose and fell onhis toes, and for ten minutes, almost without drawing breath,went on hurling himself intellectually to the assault of CharlesGould's polite silence; and when, stopping abruptly, he fell backinto his chair, it was as though he had been beaten off from afortress. To save his dignity he hastened to dismiss this silentman with a solemn inclination of the head and the words,pronounced with moody, fatigued condescension--"You may depend upon my enlightened goodwill as long as yourconduct as a good citizen deserves it."He took up a paper fan and began to cool himself with aconsequential air, while Charles Gould bowed and withdrew. Thenhe dropped the fan at once, and stared with an appearance ofwonder and perplexity at the closed door for quite a long time.At last he shrugged his shoulders as if to assure himself of hisdisdain.  Cold, dull. No intellectuality. Red hair. A trueEnglishman. He despised him.His face darkened. What meant this unimpressed and frigidbehaviour? He was the first of the successive politicians sentout from the capital to rule the Occidental Province whom themanner of Charles Gould in official intercourse was to strike asoffensively independent.Charles Gould assumed that if the appearance of listening todeplorable balderdash must form part of the price he had to payfor being left unmolested, the obligation of uttering balderdashpersonally was by no means included in the bargain. He drew theline there. To these provincial autocrats, before whom thepeaceable population of all classes had been accustomed totremble, the reserve of that English-looking engineer caused anuneasiness which swung to and fro between cringing andtruculence. Gradually all of them discovered that, no matter whatparty was in power, that man remained in most effective touchwith the higher authorities in Sta. Marta.This was a fact, and it accounted perfectly for the Goulds beingby no means so wealthy as the engineer-in-chief on the newrailway could legitimately suppose.  Following the advice of DonJose Avellanos, who was a man of good counsel (though renderedtimid by his horrible experiences of Guzman Bento's time),Charles Gould had kept clear of the capital; but in the currentgossip of the foreign residents there he was known (with a gooddeal of seriousness underlying the irony) by the nickname of"King of Sulaco." An advocate of the Costaguana Bar, a man ofreputed ability and good character, member of the distinguishedMoraga family possessing extensive estates in the Sulaco Valley,was pointed out to strangers, with a shade of mystery andrespect, as the agent of the San Tome mine--"political, youknow." He was tall, black-whiskered, and discreet.  It was knownthat he had easy access to ministers, and that the numerousCostaguana generals were always anxious to dine at his house.Presidents granted him audience with facility. He correspondedactively with his maternal uncle, Don Jose Avellanos; but hisletters--unless those expressing formally his dutifulaffection--were seldom entrusted to the Costaguana Post Office.There the envelopes are opened, indiscriminately, with thefrankness of a brazen and childish impudence characteristic ofsome Spanish-American Governments. But it must be noted that atabout the time of the re-opening of the San Tome mine themuleteer who had been employed by Charles Gould in hispreliminary travels on the Campo added his small train of animalsto the thin stream of traffic carried over the mountain passesbetween the Sta. Marta upland and the Valley of Sulaco. There areno travellers by that arduous and unsafe route unless under veryexceptional circumstances, and the state of inland trade did notvisibly require additional transport facilities; but the manseemed to find his account in it.  A few packages were alwaysfound for him whenever he took the road. Very brown and wooden,in goatskin breeches with the hair outside, he sat near the tailof his own smart mule, his great hat turned against the sun, anexpression of blissful vacancy on his long face, humming dayafter day a love-song in a plaintive key, or, without a change ofexpression, letting out a yell at his small tropilla in front. Around little guitar hung high up on his back; and there was aplace scooped out artistically in the wood of one of hispack-saddles where a tightly rolled piece of paper could beslipped in, the wooden plug replaced, and the coarse canvasnailed on again. When in Sulaco it was his practice to smoke anddoze all day long (as though he had no care in the world) on astone bench outside the doorway of the Casa Gould and facing thewindows of the Avellanos house.  Years and years ago his motherhad been chief laundry-woman in that family--very accomplished inthe matter of clear-starching. He himself had been born on one oftheir haciendas. His name was Bonifacio, and Don Jose, crossingthe street about five o'clock to call on Dona Emilia, alwaysacknowledged his humble salute by some movement of hand or head.The porters of both houses conversed lazily with him in tones ofgrave intimacy. His evenings he devoted to gambling and to callsin a spirit of generous festivity upon the peyne d'oro girls inthe more remote side-streets of the town.  But he, too, was adiscreet man.CHAPTER EIGHTTHOSE of us whom business or curiosity took to Sulaco in theseyears before the first advent of the railway can remember thesteadying effect of the San Tome mine upon the life of thatremote province. The outward appearances had not changed then asthey have changed since, as I am told, with cable cars runningalong the streets of the Constitution, and carriage roads farinto the country, to Rincon and other villages, where the foreignmerchants and the Ricos generally have their modern villas, and avast railway goods yard by the harbour, which has a quay-side, along range of warehouses, and quite serious, organized labourtroubles of its own.Nobody had ever heard of labour troubles then. The Cargadores ofthe port formed, indeed, an unruly brotherhood of all sorts ofscum, with a patron saint of their own. They went on strikeregularly (every bull-fight day), a form of trouble that evenNostromo at the height of his prestige could never cope withefficiently; but the morning after each fiesta, before the Indianmarket-women had opened their mat parasols on the plaza, when thesnows of Higuerota gleamed pale over the town on a yet black sky,the appearance of a phantom-like horseman mounted on asilver-grey mare solved the problem of labour without fail. Hissteed paced the lanes of the slums and the weed-grown enclosureswithin the old ramparts, between the black, lightless cluster ofhuts, like cow-byres, like dog-kennels.  The horseman hammeredwith the butt of a heavy revolver at the doors of low pulperias,of obscene lean-to sheds sloping against the tumble-down piece ofa noble wall, at the wooden sides of dwellings so flimsy that thesound of snores and sleepy mutters within could be heard in thepauses of the thundering clatter of his blows. He called outmen's names menacingly from the saddle, once, twice. The drowsyanswers--grumpy, conciliating, savage, jocular, ordeprecating--came out into the silent darkness in which thehorseman sat still, and presently a dark figure would flit outcoughing in the still air. Sometimes a low-toned woman criedthrough the window-hole softly, "He's coming directly, senor,"and the horseman waited silent on a motionless horse. But ifperchance he had to dismount, then, after a while, from the doorof that hovel or of that pulperia, with a ferocious scuffle andstifled imprecations, a cargador would fly out head first andhands abroad, to sprawl under the forelegs of the silver-greymare, who only pricked forward her sharp little ears. She wasused to that work; and the man, picking himself up, would walkaway hastily from Nostromo's revolver, reeling a little along thestreet and snarling low curses. At sunrise Captain Mitchell,coming out anxiously in his night attire on to the wooden balconyrunning the whole length of the O.S.N.  Company's lonely buildingby the shore, would see the lighters already under way, figuresmoving busily about the cargo cranes, perhaps hear the invaluableNostromo, now dismounted and in the checked shirt and red sash ofa Mediterranean sailor, bawling orders from the end of the jettyin a stentorian voice. A fellow in a thousand!The material apparatus of perfected civilization whichobliterates the individuality of old towns under the stereotypedconveniences of modern life had not intruded as yet; but over theworn-out antiquity of Sulaco, so characteristic with its stuccoedhouses and barred windows, with the great yellowy-white walls ofabandoned convents behind the rows of sombre green cypresses,that fact--very modern in its spirit--the San Tome mine hadalready thrown its subtle influence.  It had altered, too, theoutward character of the crowds on feast days on the plaza beforethe open portal of the cathedral, by the number of white ponchoswith a green stripe affected as holiday wear by the San Tomeminers. They had also adopted white hats with green cord andbraid--articles of good quality, which could be obtained in thestorehouse of the administration for very little money. Apeaceable Cholo wearing these colours (unusual in Costaguana) wassomehow very seldom beaten to within an inch of his life on acharge of disrespect to the town police; neither ran he much riskof being suddenly lassoed on the road by a recruiting party oflanceros--a method of voluntary enlistment looked upon as almostlegal in the Republic. Whole villages were known to havevolunteered for the army in that way; but, as Don Pepe would saywith a hopeless shrug to Mrs. Gould, "What would you! Poorpeople! Pobrecitos! Pobrecitos! But the State must have itssoldiers."Thus professionally spoke Don Pepe, the fighter, with pendentmoustaches, a nut-brown, lean face, and a clean run of acast-iron jaw, suggesting the type of a cattle-herd horseman fromthe great Llanos of the South. "If you will listen to an oldofficer of Paez, senores," was the exordium of all his speechesin the Aristocratic Club of Sulaco, where he was admitted onaccount of his past services to the extinct cause of Federation.The club, dating from the days of the proclamation ofCostaguana's independence, boasted many names of liberatorsamongst its first founders.  Suppressed arbitrarily innumerabletimes by various Governments, with memories of proscriptions andof at least one wholesale massacre of its members, sadlyassembled for a banquet by the order of a zealous militarycommandante (their bodies were afterwards stripped naked andflung into the plaza out of the windows by the lowest scum of thepopulace), it was again flourishing, at that period, peacefully.It extended to strangers the large hospitality of the cool, bigrooms of its historic quarters in the front part of a house, oncethe residence of a high official of the Holy Office. The twowings, shut up, crumbled behind the nailed doors, and what may bedescribed as a grove of young orange trees grown in the unpavedpatio concealed the utter ruin of the back part facing the gate.You turned in from the street, as if entering a secluded orchard,where you came upon the foot of a disjointed staircase, guardedby a moss-stained effigy of some saintly bishop, mitred andstaffed, and bearing the indignity of a broken nose meekly, withhis fine stone hands crossed on his breast.  Thechocolate-coloured faces of servants with mops of black hairpeeped at you from above; the click of billiard balls came toyour ears, and ascending the steps, you would perhaps see in thefirst sala, very stiff upon a straight-backed chair, in a goodlight, Don Pepe moving his long moustaches as he spelt his way,at arm's length, through an old Sta. Marta newspaper. Hishorse--a stony-hearted but persevering black brute with a hammerhead--you would have seen in the street dozing motionless underan immense saddle, with its nose almost touching the curbstone ofthe sidewalk.Don Pepe, when "down from the mountain," as the phrase, oftenheard in Sulaco, went, could also be seen in the drawing-room ofthe Casa Gould. He sat with modest assurance at some distancefrom the tea-table.  With his knees close together, and a kindlytwinkle of drollery in his deep-set eyes, he would throw hissmall and ironic pleasantries into the current of conversation.There was in that man a sort of sane, humorous shrewdness, and avein of genuine humanity so often found in simple old soldiers ofproved courage who have seen much desperate service. Of course heknew nothing whatever of mining, but his employment was of aspecial kind. He was in charge of the whole population in theterritory of the mine, which extended from the head of the gorgeto where the cart track from the foot of the mountain enters theplain, crossing a stream over a little wooden bridge paintedgreen--green, the colour of hope, being also the colour of themine.It was reported in Sulaco that up there "at the mountain" DonPepe walked about precipitous paths, girt with a great sword andin a shabby uniform with tarnished bullion epaulettes of a seniormajor. Most miners being Indians, with big wild eyes, addressedhim as Taita (father), as these barefooted people of Costaguanawill address anybody who wears shoes; but it was Basilio, Mr.Gould's own mozo and the head servant of the Casa, who, in allgood faith and from a sense of propriety, announced him once inthe solemn words, "El Senor Gobernador has arrived."Don Jose Avellanos, then in the drawing-room, was delightedbeyond measure at the aptness of the title, with which he greetedthe old major banteringly as soon as the latter's soldierlyfigure appeared in the doorway.  Don Pepe only smiled in his longmoustaches, as much as to say, "You might have found a worse namefor an old soldier."And El Senor Gobernador he had remained, with his small jokesupon his function and upon his domain, where he affirmed withhumorous exaggeration to Mrs.  Gould--"No two stones could come together anywhere without theGobernador hearing the click, senora."And he would tap his ear with the tip of his forefingerknowingly. Even when the number of the miners alone rose to oversix hundred he seemed to know each of them individually, all theinnumerable Joses, Manuels, Ignacios, from the villagesprimero--segundo--or tercero (there were three mining villages)under his government. He could distinguish them not only by theirflat, joyless faces, which to Mrs. Gould looked all alike, as ifrun into the same ancestral mould of suffering and patience, butapparently also by the infinitely graduated shades ofreddish-brown, of blackish-brown, of coppery-brown backs, as thetwo shifts, stripped to linen drawers and leather skull-caps,mingled together with a confusion of naked limbs, of shoulderedpicks, swinging lamps, in a great shuffle of sandalled feet onthe open plateau before the entrance of the main tunnel. It was atime of pause. The Indian boys leaned idly against the long lineof little cradle wagons standing empty; the screeners andore-breakers squatted on their heels smoking long cigars; thegreat wooden shoots slanting over the edge of the tunnel plateauwere silent; and only the ceaseless, violent rush of water in theopen flumes could be heard, murmuring fiercely, with the splashand rumble of revolving turbine-wheels, and the thudding march ofthe stamps pounding to powder the treasure rock on the plateaubelow.  The heads of gangs, distinguished by brass medals hangingon their bare breasts, marshalled their squads; and at last themountain would swallow one-half of the silent crowd, while theother half would move off in long files down the zigzag pathsleading to the bottom of the gorge. It was deep; and, far below,a thread of vegetation winding between the blazing rock facesresembled a slender green cord, in which three lumpy knots ofbanana patches, palm-leaf roots, and shady trees marked theVillage One, Village Two, Village Three, housing the miners ofthe Gould Concession.Whole families had been moving from the first towards the spot inthe Higuerota range, whence the rumour of work and safety hadspread over the pastoral Campo, forcing its way also, even as thewaters of a high flood, into the nooks and crannies of thedistant blue walls of the Sierras. Father first, in a pointedstraw hat, then the mother with the bigger children, generallyalso a diminutive donkey, all under burdens, except the leaderhimself, or perhaps some grown girl, the pride of the family,stepping barefooted and straight as an arrow, with braids ofraven hair, a thick, haughty profile, and no load to carry butthe small guitar of the country and a pair of soft leathersandals tied together on her back. At the sight of such partiesstrung out on the cross trails between the pastures, or camped bythe side of the royal road, travellers on horseback would remarkto each other--"More people going to the San Tome mine. We shall see othersto-morrow."And spurring on in the dusk they would discuss the great news ofthe province, the news of the San Tome mine. A rich Englishmanwas going to work it--and perhaps not an Englishman, Quien sabe!A foreigner with much money. Oh, yes, it had begun. A party ofmen who had been to Sulaco with a herd of black bulls for thenext corrida had reported that from the porch of the posada inRincon, only a short league from the town, the lights on themountain were visible, twinkling above the trees. And there was awoman seen riding a horse sideways, not in the chair seat, butupon a sort of saddle, and a man's hat on her head. She walkedabout, too, on foot up the mountain paths. A woman engineer, itseemed she was."What an absurdity! Impossible, senor!""Si! Si! Una Americana del Norte.""Ah, well! if your worship is informed. Una Americana; it need besomething of that sort."And they would laugh a little with astonishment and scorn,keeping a wary eye on the shadows of the road, for one is liableto meet bad men when travelling late on the Campo.And it was not only the men that Don Pepe knew so well, but heseemed able, with one attentive, thoughtful glance, to classifyeach woman, girl, or growing youth of his domain. It was only thesmall fry that puzzled him sometimes. He and the padre could beseen frequently side by side, meditative and gazing across thestreet of a village at a lot of sedate brown children, trying tosort them out, as it were, in low, consulting tones, or else theywould together put searching questions as to the parentage ofsome small, staid urchin met wandering, naked and grave, alongthe road with a cigar in his baby mouth, and perhaps his mother'srosary, purloined for purposes of ornamentation, hanging in aloop of beads low down on his rotund little stomach. Thespiritual and temporal pastors of the mine flock were very goodfriends. With Dr. Monygham, the medical pastor, who had acceptedthe charge from Mrs. Gould, and lived in the hospital building,they were on not so intimate terms. But no one could be onintimate terms with El Senor Doctor, who, with his twistedshoulders, drooping head, sardonic mouth, and side-long bitterglance, was mysterious and uncanny.  The other two authoritiesworked in harmony.  Father Roman, dried-up, small, alert,wrinkled, with big round eyes, a sharp chin, and a greatsnuff-taker, was an old campaigner, too; he had shriven manysimple souls on the battlefields of the Republic, kneeling by thedying on hillsides, in the long grass, in the gloom of theforests, to hear the last confession with the smell of gunpowdersmoke in his nostrils, the rattle of muskets, the hum and spatterof bullets in his ears. And where was the harm if, at thepresbytery, they had a game with a pack of greasy cards in theearly evening, before Don Pepe went his last rounds to see thatall the watchmen of the mine--a body organized by himself--wereat their posts? For that last duty before he slept Don Pepe didactually gird his old sword on the verandah of an unmistakableAmerican white frame house, which Father Roman called thepresbytery. Near by, a long, low, dark building, steeple-roofed,like a vast barn with a wooden cross over the gable, was theminers' chapel. There Father Roman said Mass every day before asombre altar-piece representing the Resurrection, the grey slabof the tombstone balanced on one corner, a figure soaringupwards, long-limbed and livid, in an oval of pallid light, and ahelmeted brown legionary smitten down, right across thebituminous foreground. "This picture, my children, muy linda emaravillosa," Father Roman would say to some of his flock, "whichyou behold here through the munificence of the wife of our SenorAdministrador, has been painted in Europe, a country of saintsand miracles, and much greater than our Costaguana." And he wouldtake a pinch of snuff with unction. But when once an inquisitivespirit desired to know in what direction this Europe wassituated, whether up or down the coast, Father Roman, to concealhis perplexity, became very reserved and severe. "No doubt it isextremely far away. But ignorant sinners like you of the San Tomemine should think earnestly of everlasting punishment instead ofinquiring into the magnitude of the earth, with its countries andpopulations altogether beyond your understanding."With a "Good-night, Padre," "Good-night, Don Pepe," theGobernador would go off, holding up his sabre against his side,his body bent forward, with a long, plodding stride in the dark.The jocularity proper to an innocent card game for a few cigarsor a bundle of yerba was replaced at once by the stern duty moodof an officer setting out to visit the outposts of an encampedarmy. One loud blast of the whistle that hung from his neckprovoked instantly a great shrilling of responding whistles,mingled with the barking of dogs, that would calm down slowly atlast, away up at the head of the gorge; and in the stillness twoserenos, on guard by the bridge, would appear walking noiselesslytowards him. On one side of the road a long frame building--thestore--would be closed and barricaded from end to end; facing itanother white frame house, still longer, and with a verandah--thehospital--would have lights in the two windows of Dr. Monygham'squarters. Even the delicate foliage of a clump of pepper treesdid not stir, so breathless would be the darkness warmed by theradiation of the over-heated rocks. Don Pepe would stand stillfor a moment with the two motionless serenos before him, and,abruptly, high up on the sheer face of the mountain, dotted withsingle torches, like drops of fire fallen from the two greatblazing clusters of lights above, the ore shoots would begin torattle. The great clattering, shuffling noise, gathering speedand weight, would be caught up by the walls of the gorge, andsent upon the plain in a growl of thunder. The pasadero in Rinconswore that on calm nights, by listening intently, he could catchthe sound in his doorway as of a storm in the mountains.To Charles Gould's fancy it seemed that the sound must reach theuttermost limits of the province. Riding at night towards themine, it would meet him at the edge of a little wood just beyondRincon. There was no mistaking the growling mutter of themountain pouring its stream of treasure under the stamps; and itcame to his heart with the peculiar force of a proclamationthundered forth over the land and the marvellousness of anaccomplished fact fulfilling an audacious desire. He had heardthis very sound in his imagination on that far-off evening whenhis wife and himself, after a tortuous ride through a strip offorest, had reined in their horses near the stream, and had gazedfor the first time upon the jungle-grown solitude of the gorge.The head of a palm rose here and there. In a high ravine roundthe corner of the San Tome mountain (which is square like ablockhouse) the thread of a slender waterfall flashed bright andglassy through the dark green of the heavy fronds of tree-ferns.Don Pepe, in attendance, rode up, and, stretching his arm up thegorge, had declared with mock solemnity, "Behold the veryparadise of snakes, senora."And then they had wheeled their horses and ridden back to sleepthat night at Rincon. The alcalde--an old, skinny Moreno, asergeant of Guzman Bento's time--had cleared respectfully out ofhis house with his three pretty daughters, to make room for theforeign senora and their worships the Caballeros. All he askedCharles Gould (whom he took for a mysterious and official person)to do for him was to remind the supreme Government--El Gobiernosupreme--of a pension (amounting to about a dollar a month) towhich he believed himself entitled. It had been promised to him,he affirmed, straightening his bent back martially, "many yearsago, for my valour in the wars with the wild Indios when a youngman, senor."The waterfall existed no longer. The tree-ferns that hadluxuriated in its spray had died around the dried-up pool, andthe high ravine was only a big trench half filled up with therefuse of excavations and tailings.  The torrent, dammed upabove, sent its water rushing along the open flumes of scoopedtree trunks striding on trestle-legs to the turbines working thestamps on the lower plateau--the mesa grande of the San Tomemountain. Only the memory of the waterfall, with its amazingfernery, like a hanging garden above the rocks of the gorge, waspreserved in Mrs. Gould's water-colour sketch; she had made ithastily one day from a cleared patch in the bushes, sitting inthe shade of a roof of straw erected for her on three rough polesunder Don Pepe's direction.Mrs. Gould had seen it all from the beginning: the clearing ofthe wilderness, the making of the road, the cutting of new pathsup the cliff face of San Tome. For weeks together she had livedon the spot with her husband; and she was so little in Sulacoduring that year that the appearance of the Gould carriage on theAlameda would cause a social excitement. From the heavy familycoaches full of stately senoras and black-eyed senoritas rollingsolemnly in the shaded alley white hands were waved towards herwith animation in a flutter of greetings. Dona Emilia was "downfrom the mountain."But not for long. Dona Emilia would be gone "up to the mountain"in a day or two, and her sleek carriage mules would have an easytime of it for another long spell. She had watched the erectionof the first frame-house put up on the lower mesa for an officeand Don Pepe's quarters; she heard with a thrill of thankfulemotion the first wagon load of ore rattle down the then onlyshoot; she had stood by her husband's side perfectly silent, andgone cold all over with excitement at the instant when the firstbattery of only fifteen stamps was put in motion for the firsttime. On the occasion when the fires under the first set ofretorts in their shed had glowed far into the night she did notretire to rest on the rough cadre set up for her in the as yetbare frame-house till she had seen the first spongy lump ofsilver yielded to the hazards of the world by the dark depths ofthe Gould Concession; she had laid her unmercenary hands, with aneagerness that made them tremble, upon the first silver ingotturned out still warm from the mould; and by her imaginativeestimate of its power she endowed that lump of metal with ajustificative conception, as though it were not a mere fact, butsomething far-reaching and impalpable, like the true expressionof an emotion or the emergence of a principle.Don Pepe, extremely interested, too, looked over her shoulderwith a smile that, making longitudinal folds on his face, causedit to resemble a leathern mask with a benignantly diabolicexpression."Would not the muchachos of Hernandez like to get hold of thisinsignificant object, that looks, por Dios, very much like apiece of tin?" he remarked, jocularly.Hernandez, the robber, had been an inoffensive, small ranchero,kidnapped with circumstances of peculiar atrocity from his homeduring one of the civil wars, and forced to serve in the army.There his conduct as soldier was exemplary, till, watching hischance, he killed his colonel, and managed to get clear away.With a band of deserters, who chose him for their chief, he hadtaken refuge beyond the wild and waterless Bolson de Tonoro. Thehaciendas paid him blackmail in cattle and horses; extraordinarystories were told of his powers and of his wonderful escapes fromcapture. He used to ride, single-handed, into the villages andthe little towns on the Campo, driving a pack mule before him,with two revolvers in his belt, go straight to the shop or store,select what he wanted, and ride away unopposed because of theterror his exploits and his audacity inspired.  Poor countrypeople he usually left alone; the upper class were often stoppedon the roads and robbed; but any unlucky official that fell intohis hands was sure to get a severe flogging. The army officersdid not like his name to be mentioned in their presence. Hisfollowers, mounted on stolen horses, laughed at the pursuit ofthe regular cavalry sent to hunt them down, and whom they tookpleasure to ambush most scientifically in the broken ground oftheir own fastness. Expeditions had been fitted out; a price hadbeen put upon his head; even attempts had been made,treacherously of course, to open negotiations with him, withoutin the slightest way affecting the even tenor of his career. Atlast, in true Costaguana fashion, the Fiscal of Tonoro, who wasambitious of the glory of having reduced the famous Hernandez,offered him a sum of money and a safe conduct out of the countryfor the betrayal of his band. But Hernandez evidently was not ofthe stuff of which the distinguished military politicians andconspirators of Costaguana are made. This clever but commondevice (which frequently works like a charm in putting downrevolutions) failed with the chief of vulgar Salteadores. Itpromised well for the Fiscal at first, but ended very badly forthe squadron of lanceros posted (by the Fiscal's directions) in afold of the ground into which Hernandez had promised to lead hisunsuspecting followers  They came, indeed, at the appointed time,but creeping on their hands and knees through the bush, and onlylet their presence be known by a general discharge of firearms,which emptied many saddles. The troopers who escaped came ridingvery hard into Tonoro. It is said that their commanding officer(who, being better mounted, rode far ahead of the rest)afterwards got into a state of despairing intoxication and beatthe ambitious Fiscal severely with the flat of his sabre in thepresence of his wife and daughters, for bringing this disgraceupon the National Army. The highest civil official of Tonoro,falling to the ground in a swoon, was further kicked all over thebody and rowelled with sharp spurs about the neck and facebecause of the great sensitiveness of his military colleague.This gossip of the inland Campo, so characteristic of the rulersof the country with its story of oppression, inefficiency,fatuous methods, treachery, and savage brutality, was perfectlyknown to Mrs. Gould. That it should be accepted with no indignantcomment by people of intelligence, refinement, and character assomething inherent in the nature of things was one of thesymptoms of degradation that had the power to exasperate heralmost to the verge of despair. Still looking at the ingot ofsilver, she shook her head at Don Pepe's remark--"If it had not been for the lawless tyranny of your Government,Don Pepe, many an outlaw now with Hernandez would be livingpeaceably and happy by the honest work of his hands.""Senora," cried Don Pepe, with enthusiasm, "it is true! It is asif God had given you the power to look into the very breasts ofpeople. You have seen them working round you, Dona Emilia--meekas lambs, patient like their own burros, brave like lions. I haveled them to the very muzzles of guns--I, who stand here beforeyou, senora--in the time of Paez, who was full of generosity, andin courage only approached by the uncle of Don Carlos here, asfar as I know. No wonder there are bandits in the Campo whenthere are none but thieves, swindlers, and sanguinary macaques torule us in Sta. Marta. However, all the same, a bandit is abandit, and we shall have a dozen good straight Winchesters toride with the silver down to Sulaco."Mrs. Gould's ride with the first silver escort to Sulaco was theclosing episode of what she called "my camp life" before she hadsettled in her town-house permanently, as was proper and evennecessary for the wife of the administrator of such an importantinstitution as the San Tome mine. For the San Tome mine was tobecome an institution, a rallying point for everything in theprovince that needed order and stability to live.  Securityseemed to flow upon this land from the mountain-gorge. Theauthorities of Sulaco had learned that the San Tome mine couldmake it worth their while to leave things and people alone. Thiswas the nearest approach to the rule of common-sense and justiceCharles Gould felt it possible to secure at first. In fact, themine, with its organization, its population growing fiercelyattached to their position of privileged safety, with itsarmoury, with its Don Pepe, with its armed body of serenos(where, it was said, many an outlaw and deserter--and even somemembers of Hernandez's band--had found a place), the mine was apower in the land. As a certain prominent man in Sta. Marta hadexclaimed with a hollow laugh, once, when discussing the line ofaction taken by the Sulaco authorities at a time of politicalcrisis--"You call these men Government officials? They?  Never! They areofficials of the mine--officials of the Concession--I tell you."The prominent man (who was then a person in power, with alemon-coloured face and a very short and curly, not to saywoolly, head of hair) went so far in his temporary discontent asto shake his yellow fist under the nose of his interlocutor, andshriek--"Yes! All! Silence! All! I tell you! The political Gefe, thechief of the police, the chief of the customs, the general, all,all, are the officials of that Gould."Thereupon an intrepid but low and argumentative murmur would flowon for a space in the ministerial cabinet, and the prominentman's passion would end in a cynical shrug of the shoulders.After all, he seemed to say, what did it matter as long as theminister himself was not forgotten during his brief day ofauthority?  But all the same, the unofficial agent of the SanTome mine, working for a good cause, had his moments of anxiety,which were reflected in his letters to Don Jose Avellanos, hismaternal uncle."No sanguinary macaque from Sta. Marta shall set foot on thatpart of Costaguana which lies beyond the San Tome bridge," DonPepe used to assure Mrs.  Gould. "Except, of course, as anhonoured guest--for our Senor Administrador is a deep politico."But to Charles Gould, in his own room, the old Major would remarkwith a grim and soldierly cheeriness, "We are all playing ourheads at this game."Don Jose Avellanos would mutter "Imperium in imperio, Emilia, mysoul," with an air of profound self-satisfaction which, somehow,in a curious way, seemed to contain a queer admixture of bodilydiscomfort.  But that, perhaps, could only be visible to theinitiated.  And for the initiated it was a wonderful place, thisdrawing-room of the Casa Gould, with its momentary glimpses ofthe master--El Senor Administrador--older, harder, mysteriouslysilent, with the lines deepened on his English, ruddy,out-of-doors complexion; flitting on his thin cavalryman's legsacross the doorways, either just "back from the mountain" or withjingling spurs and riding-whip under his arm, on the point ofstarting "for the mountain."   Then Don Pepe, modestly martial inhis chair, the llanero who seemed somehow to have found hismartial jocularity, his knowledge of the world, and his mannerperfect for his station, in the midst of savage armed contestswith his kind; Avellanos, polished and familiar, the diplomatistwith his loquacity covering much caution and wisdom in delicateadvice, with his manuscript of a historical work on Costaguana,entitled "Fifty Years of Misrule," which, at present, he thoughtit was not prudent (even if it were possible) "to give to theworld"; these three, and also Dona Emilia amongst them, gracious,small, and fairy-like, before the glittering tea-set, with onecommon master-thought in their heads, with one common feeling ofa tense situation, with one ever-present aim to preserve theinviolable character of the mine at every cost.  And there wasalso to be seen Captain Mitchell, a little apart, near one of thelong windows, with an air of old-fashioned neat old bachelorhoodabout him, slightly pompous, in a white waistcoat, a littledisregarded and unconscious of it; utterly in the dark, andimagining himself to be in the thick of things. The good man,having spent a clear thirty years of his life on the high seasbefore getting what he called a "shore billet," was astonished atthe importance of transactions (other than relating to shipping)which take place on dry land. Almost every event out of the usualdaily course "marked an epoch" for him or else was "history";unless with his pomposity struggling with a discomfited droop ofhis rubicund, rather handsome face, set off by snow-white closehair and short whiskers, he would mutter--"Ah, that! That, sir, was a mistake."The reception of the first consignment of San Tome silver forshipment to San Francisco in one of the O.S.N.  Co.'s mail-boatshad, of course, "marked an epoch" for Captain Mitchell. Theingots packed in boxes of stiff ox-hide with plaited handles,small enough to be carried easily by two men, were brought downby the serenos of the mine walking in careful couples along thehalf-mile or so of steep, zigzag paths to the foot of themountain. There they would be loaded into a string of two-wheeledcarts, resembling roomy coffers with a door at the back, andharnessed tandem with two mules each, waiting under the guard ofarmed and mounted serenos. Don Pepe padlocked each door insuccession, and at the signal of his whistle the string of cartswould move off, closely surrounded by the clank of spur andcarbine, with jolts and cracking of whips, with a sudden deeprumble over the boundary bridge ("into the land of thieves andsanguinary macaques," Don Pepe defined that crossing); hatsbobbing in the first light of the dawn, on the heads of cloakedfigures; Winchesters on hip; bridle hands protruding lean andbrown from under the falling folds of the ponchos. The convoyskirting a little wood, along the mine trail, between the mudhuts and low walls of Rincon, increased its pace on the caminoreal, mules urged to speed, escort galloping, Don Carlos ridingalone ahead of a dust storm affording a vague vision of long earsof mules, of fluttering little green and white flags stuck uponeach cart; of raised arms in a mob of sombreros with the whitegleam of ranging eyes; and Don Pepe, hardly visible in the rearof that rattling dust trail, with a stiff seat and impassiveface, rising and falling rhythmically on an ewe-neckedsilver-bitted black brute with a hammer head.The sleepy people in the little clusters of huts, in the smallranches near the road, recognized by the headlong sound thecharge of the San Tome silver escort towards the crumbling wallof the city on the Campo side.  They came to the doors to see itdash by over ruts and stones, with a clatter and clank andcracking of whips, with the reckless rush and precise driving ofa field battery hurrying into action, and the solitary Englishfigure of the Senor Administrador riding far ahead in the lead.In the fenced roadside paddocks loose horses galloped wildly fora while; the heavy cattle stood up breast deep in the grass,lowing mutteringly at the flying noise; a meek Indian villagerwould glance back once and hasten to shove his loaded littledonkey bodily against a wall, out of the way of the San Tomesilver escort going to the sea; a small knot of chilly leperosunder the Stone Horse of the Alameda would mutter: "Caramba!" onseeing it take a wide curve at a gallop and dart into the emptyStreet of the Constitution; for it was considered the correctthing, the only proper style by the mule-drivers of the San Tomemine to go through the waking town from end to end without acheck in the speed as if chased by a devil.The early sunshine glowed on the delicate primrose, pale pink,pale blue fronts of the big houses with all their gates shut yet,and no face behind the iron bars of the windows. In the wholesunlit range of empty balconies along the street only one whitefigure would be visible high up above the clear pavement--thewife of the Senor Administrador--leaning over to see the escortgo by to the harbour, a mass of heavy, fair hair twisted upnegligently on her little head, and a lot of lace about the neckof her muslin wrapper. With a smile to her husband's single,quick, upward glance, she would watch the whole thing stream pastbelow her feet with an orderly uproar, till she answered by afriendly sign the salute of the galloping Don Pepe, the stiff,deferential inclination with a sweep of the hat below the knee.The string of padlocked carts lengthened, the size of the escortgrew bigger as the years went on. Every three months anincreasing stream of treasure swept through the streets of Sulacoon its way to the strong room in the O.S.N. Co.'s building by theharbour, there to await shipment for the North. Increasing involume, and of immense value also; for, as Charles Gould told hiswife once with some exultation, there had never been seenanything in the world to approach the vein of the GouldConcession. For them both, each passing of the escort under thebalconies of the Casa Gould was like another victory gained inthe conquest of peace for Sulaco.No doubt the initial action of Charles Gould had been helped atthe beginning by a period of comparative peace which occurredjust about that time; and also by the general softening ofmanners as compared with the epoch of civil wars whence hademerged the iron tyranny of Guzman Bento of fearful memory. Inthe contests that broke out at the end of his rule (which hadkept peace in the country for a whole fifteen years) there wasmore fatuous imbecility, plenty of cruelty and suffering still,but much less of the old-time fierce and blindly ferociouspolitical fanaticism. It was all more vile, more base, morecontemptible, and infinitely more manageable in the veryoutspoken cynicism of motives.  It was more clearly abrazen-faced scramble for a constantly diminishing quantity ofbooty; since all enterprise had been stupidly killed in the land.Thus it came to pass that the province of Sulaco, once the fieldof cruel party vengeances, had become in a way one of theconsiderable prizes of political career. The great of the earth(in Sta. Marta) reserved the posts in the old Occidental State tothose nearest and dearest to them:  nephews, brothers, husbandsof favourite sisters, bosom friends, trusty supporters--orprominent supporters of whom perhaps they were afraid. It was theblessed province of great opportunities and of largest salaries;for the San Tome mine had its own unofficial pay list, whoseitems and amounts, fixed in consultation by Charles Gould andSenor Avellanos, were known to a prominent business man in theUnited States, who for twenty minutes or so in every month gavehis undivided attention to Sulaco affairs. At the same time thematerial interests of all sorts, backed up by the influence ofthe San Tome mine, were quietly gathering substance in that partof the Republic. If, for instance, the Sulaco Collectorship wasgenerally understood, in the political world of the capital, toopen the way to the Ministry of Finance, and so on for everyofficial post, then, on the other hand, the despondent businesscircles of the Republic had come to consider the OccidentalProvince as the promised land of safety, especially if a manmanaged to get on good terms with the administration of the mine."Charles Gould; excellent fellow!  Absolutely necessary to makesure of him before taking a single step. Get an introduction tohim from Moraga if you can--the agent of the King of Sulaco,don't you know."No wonder, then, that Sir John, coming from Europe to smooth thepath for his railway, had been meeting the name (and even thenickname) of Charles Gould at every turn in Costaguana. The agentof the San Tome Administration in Sta. Marta (a polished,well-informed gentleman, Sir John thought him) John had certainlyhelped so greatly in bringing about the presidential tour that hebegan to think that there was something in the faint whispershinting at the immense occult influence of the Gould Concession.What was currently whispered was this--that the San TomeAdministration had, in part, at least, financed the lastrevolution, which had brought into a five-year dictatorship DonVincente Ribiera, a man of culture and of unblemished character,invested with a mandate of reform by the best elements of theState. Serious, well-informed men seemed to believe the fact, tohope for better things, for the establishment of legality, ofgood faith and order in public life. So much the better, then,thought Sir John.  He worked always on a great scale; there was aloan to the State, and a project for systematic colonization ofthe Occidental Province, involved in one vast scheme with theconstruction of the National Central Railway.  Good faith, order,honesty, peace, were badly wanted for this great development ofmaterial interests. Anybody on the side of these things, andespecially if able to help, had an importance in Sir John's eyes.He had not been disappointed in the "King of Sulaco." The localdifficulties had fallen away, as the engineer-in-chief hadforetold they would, before Charles Gould's mediation.  Sir Johnhad been extremely feted in Sulaco, next to thePresident-Dictator, a fact which might have accounted for theevident ill-humour General Montero displayed at lunch given onboard the Juno just before she was to sail, taking away fromSulaco the President-Dictator and the distinguished foreign guestsin his train.The Excellentissimo ("the hope of honest men," as Don Jose hadaddressed him in a public speech delivered in the name of theProvincial Assembly of Sulaco) sat at the head of the long table;Captain Mitchell, positively stony-eyed and purple in the facewith the solemnity of this "historical event," occupied the footas the representative of the O.S.N. Company in Sulaco, the hostsof that informal function, with the captain of the ship and someminor officials from the shore around him. Those cheery, swarthylittle gentlemen cast jovial side-glances at the bottles ofchampagne beginning to pop behind the guests' backs in the handsof the ship's stewards.  The amber wine creamed up to the rims ofthe glasses.Charles Gould had his place next to a foreign envoy, who, in alistless undertone, had been talking to him fitfully of huntingand shooting. The well-nourished, pale face, with an eyeglass anddrooping yellow moustache, made the Senor Administrador appear bycontrast twice as sunbaked, more flaming red, a hundred timesmore intensely and silently alive. Don Jose Avellanos touchedelbows with the other foreign diplomat, a dark man with a quiet,watchful, self-confident demeanour, and a touch of reserve. Alletiquette being laid aside on the occasion, General Montero wasthe only one there in full uniform, so stiff with embroideries infront that his broad chest seemed protected by a cuirass of gold.Sir John at the beginning had got away from high places for thesake of sitting near Mrs.  Gould.The great financier was trying to express to her his gratefulsense of her hospitality and of his obligation to her husband's"enormous influence in this part of the country," when sheinterrupted him by a low "Hush!" The President was going to makean informal pronouncement.The Excellentissimo was on his legs. He said only a few words,evidently deeply felt, and meant perhaps mostly forAvellanos--his old friend--as to the necessity of unremittingeffort to secure the lasting welfare of the country emergingafter this last struggle, he hoped, into a period of peace andmaterial prosperity.Mrs. Gould, listening to the mellow, slightly mournful voice,looking at this rotund, dark, spectacled face, at the short body,obese to the point of infirmity, thought that this man ofdelicate and melancholy mind, physically almost a cripple, comingout of his retirement into a dangerous strife at the call of hisfellows, had the right to speak with the authority of hisself-sacrifice. And yet she was made uneasy. He was more patheticthan promising, this first civilian Chief of the State Costaguanahad ever known, pronouncing, glass in hand, his simple watchwordsof honesty, peace, respect for law, political good faith abroadand at home--the safeguards of national honour.He sat down. During the respectful, appreciative buzz of voicesthat followed the speech, General Montero raised a pair of heavy,drooping eyelids and rolled his eyes with a sort of uneasydullness from face to face. The military backwoods hero of theparty, though secretly impressed by the sudden novelties andsplendours of his position (he had never been on board a shipbefore, and had hardly ever seen the sea except from a distance),understood by a sort of instinct the advantage his surly,unpolished attitude of a savage fighter gave him amongst allthese refined Blanco aristocrats. But why was it that nobody waslooking at him? he wondered to himself angrily. He was able tospell out the print of newspapers, and knew that he had performedthe "greatest military exploit of modern times.""My husband wanted the railway," Mrs. Gould said to Sir John inthe general murmur of resumed conversations.  "All this bringsnearer the sort of future we desire for the country, which haswaited for it in sorrow long enough, God knows. But I willconfess that the other day, during my afternoon drive when Isuddenly saw an Indian boy ride out of a wood with the red flagof a surveying party in his hand, I felt something of a shock.The future means change--an utter change.  And yet even herethere are simple and picturesque things that one would like topreserve."Sir John listened, smiling. But it was his turn now to hush Mrs.Gould."General Montero is going to speak," he whispered, and almostimmediately added, in comic alarm, "Heavens!  he's going topropose my own health, I believe."General Montero had risen with a jingle of steel scabbard and aripple of glitter on his gold-embroidered breast; a heavysword-hilt appeared at his side above the edge of the table. Inthis gorgeous uniform, with his bull neck, his hooked noseflattened on the tip upon a blue-black, dyed moustache, he lookedlike a disguised and sinister vaquero. The drone of his voice hada strangely rasping, soulless ring. He floundered, lowering,through a few vague sentences; then suddenly raising his big headand his voice together, burst out harshly--"The honour of the country is in the hands of the army. I assureyou I shall be faithful to it." He hesitated till his roamingeyes met Sir John's face upon which he fixed a lurid, sleepyglance; and the figure of the lately negotiated loan came intohis mind. He lifted his glass. "I drink to the health of the manwho brings us a million and a half of pounds."He tossed off his champagne, and sat down heavily with ahalf-surprised, half-bullying look all round the faces in theprofound, as if appalled, silence which succeeded the felicitoustoast. Sir John did not move."I don't think I am called upon to rise," he murmured to Mrs.Gould. "That sort of thing speaks for itself." But Don JoseAvellanos came to the rescue with a short oration, in which healluded pointedly to England's goodwill towards Costaguana--"agoodwill," he continued, significantly, "of which I, having beenin my time accredited to the Court of St. James, am able to speakwith some knowledge."Only then Sir John thought fit to respond, which he didgracefully in bad French, punctuated by bursts of applause andthe "Hear! Hears!" of Captain Mitchell, who was able tounderstand a word now and then.  Directly he had done, thefinancier of railways turned to Mrs. Gould--"You were good enough to say that you intended to ask me forsomething," he reminded her, gallantly.  "What is it? Be assuredthat any request from you would be considered in the light of afavour to myself."She thanked him by a gracious smile. Everybody was rising fromthe table."Let us go on deck," she proposed, "where I'll be able to pointout to you the very object of my request."An enormous national flag of Costaguana, diagonal red and yellow,with two green palm trees in the middle, floated lazily at themainmast head of the Juno. A multitude of fireworks being let offin their thousands at the water's edge in honour of the Presidentkept up a mysterious crepitating noise half round the harbour.Now and then a lot of rockets, swishing upwards invisibly,detonated overhead with only a puff of smoke in the bright sky.Crowds of people could be seen between the town gate and theharbour, under the bunches of multicoloured flags fluttering ontall poles.  Faint bursts of military music would be heardsuddenly, and the remote sound of shouting. A knot of raggednegroes at the end of the wharf kept on loading and firing asmall iron cannon time after time. A greyish haze of dust hungthin and motionless against the sun.Don Vincente Ribiera made a few steps under the deck-awning,leaning on the arm of Senor Avellanos; a wide circle was formedround him, where the mirthless smile of his dark lips and thesightless glitter of his spectacles could be seen turning amiablyfrom side to side. The informal function arranged on purpose onboard the Juno to give the President-Dictator an opportunity tomeet intimately some of his most notable adherents in Sulaco wasdrawing to an end. On one side, General Montero, his bald headcovered now by a plumed cocked hat, remained motionless on askylight seat, a pair of big gauntleted hands folded on the hiltof the sabre standing upright between his legs. The white plume,the coppery tint of his broad face, the blue-black of themoustaches under the curved beak, the mass of gold on sleeves andbreast, the high shining boots with enormous spurs, the workingnostrils, the imbecile and domineering stare of the gloriousvictor of Rio Seco had in them something ominous and incredible;the exaggeration of a cruel caricature, the fatuity of solemnmasquerading, the atrocious grotesqueness of some military idolof Aztec conception and European bedecking, awaiting the homageof worshippers.  Don Jose approached diplomatically this weirdand inscrutable portent, and Mrs. Gould turned her fascinatedeyes away at last.Charles, coming up to take leave of Sir John, heard him say, ashe bent over his wife's hand, "Certainly.  Of course, my dearMrs. Gould, for a protege of yours!  Not the slightestdifficulty. Consider it done."Going ashore in the same boat with the Goulds, Don Jose Avellanoswas very silent. Even in the Gould carriage he did not open hislips for a long time. The mules trotted slowly away from thewharf between the extended hands of the beggars, who for that dayseemed to have abandoned in a body the portals of churches.Charles Gould sat on the back seat and looked away upon theplain. A multitude of booths made of green boughs, of rushes, ofodd pieces of plank eked out with bits of canvas had been erectedall over it for the sale of cana, of dulces, of fruit, of cigars.Over little heaps of glowing charcoal Indian women, squatting onmats, cooked food in black earthen pots, and boiled the water forthe mate gourds, which they offered in soft, caressing voices tothe country people. A racecourse had been staked out for thevaqueros; and away to the left, from where the crowd was massedthickly about a huge temporary erection, like a circus tent ofwood with a conical grass roof, came the resonant twanging ofharp strings, the sharp ping of guitars, with the grave drummingthrob of an Indian gombo pulsating steadily through the shrillchoruses of the dancers.Charles Gould said presently--"All this piece of land belongs now to the Railway Company. Therewill be no more popular feasts held here."Mrs. Gould was rather sorry to think so. She took thisopportunity to mention how she had just obtained from Sir Johnthe promise that the house occupied by Giorgio Viola should notbe interfered with. She declared she could never understand whythe survey engineers ever talked of demolishing that oldbuilding.  It was not in the way of the projected harbour branchof the line in the least.She stopped the carriage before the door to reassure at once theold Genoese, who came out bare-headed and stood by the carriagestep. She talked to him in Italian, of course, and he thanked herwith calm dignity.  An old Garibaldino was grateful to her fromthe bottom of his heart for keeping the roof over the heads ofhis wife and children. He was too old to wander any more."And is it for ever, signora?" he asked."For as long as you like.""Bene. Then the place must be named, It was not worth whilebefore."He smiled ruggedly, with a running together of wrinkles at thecorners of his eyes. "I shall set about the painting of the nameto-morrow.""And what is it going to be, Giorgio?""Albergo d'Italia Una," said the old Garibaldino, looking awayfor a moment. "More in memory of those who have died," he added,"than for the country stolen from us soldiers of liberty by thecraft of that accursed Piedmontese race of kings and ministers."Mrs. Gould smiled slightly, and, bending over a little, began toinquire about his wife and children. He had sent them into townon that day. The padrona was better in health; many thanks to thesignora for inquiring.People were passing in twos and threes, in whole parties of menand women attended by trotting children.  A horseman mounted on asilver-grey mare drew rein quietly in the shade of the houseafter taking off his hat to the party in the carriage, whoreturned smiles and familiar nods. Old Viola, evidently verypleased with the news he had just heard, interrupted himself fora moment to tell him rapidly that the house was secured, by thekindness of the English signora, for as long as he liked to keepit. The other listened attentively, but made no response.When the carriage moved on he took off his hat again, a greysombrero with a silver cord and tassels. The bright colours of aMexican serape twisted on the cantle, the enormous silver buttonson the embroidered leather jacket, the row of tiny silver buttonsdown the seam of the trousers, the snowy linen, a silk sash withembroidered ends, the silver plates on headstall and saddle,proclaimed the unapproachable style of the famous Capataz deCargadores--a Mediterranean sailor--got up with more finishedsplendour than any well-to-do young ranchero of the Campo hadever displayed on a high holiday."It is a great thing for me," murmured old Giorgio, stillthinking of the house, for now he had grown weary of change. "Thesignora just said a word to the Englishman.""The old Englishman who has enough money to pay for a railway? Heis going off in an hour," remarked Nostromo, carelessly.   "Buonviaggio, then.  I've guarded his bones all the way from theEntrada pass down to the plain and into Sulaco, as though he hadbeen my own father."Old Giorgio only moved his head sideways absently.  Nostromopointed after the Goulds' carriage, nearing the grass-grown gatein the old town wall that was like a wall of matted jungle."And I have sat alone at night with my revolver in the Company'swarehouse time and again by the side of that other Englishman'sheap of silver, guarding it as though it had been my own."Viola seemed lost in thought. "It is a great thing for me," herepeated again, as if to himself."It is," agreed the magnificent Capataz de Cargadores, calmly."Listen, Vecchio--go in and bring me, out a cigar, but don't lookfor it in my room. There's nothing there."Viola stepped into the cafe and came out directly, still absorbedin his idea, and tendered him a cigar, mumbling thoughtfully inhis moustache, "Children growing up--and girls, too! Girls!" Hesighed and fell silent."What, only one?" remarked Nostromo, looking down with a sort ofcomic inquisitiveness at the unconscious old man. "No matter," headded, with lofty negligence; "one is enough till another iswanted."He lit it and let the match drop from his passive fingers.Giorgio Viola looked up, and said abruptly--"My son would have been just such a fine young man as you, Gian'Battista, if he had lived.""What? Your son? But you are right, padrone.  If he had been likeme he would have been a man."He turned his horse slowly, and paced on between the booths,checking the mare almost to a standstill now and then forchildren, for the groups of people from the distant Campo, whostared after him with admiration.  The Company's lightermensaluted him from afar; and the greatly envied Capataz deCargadores advanced, amongst murmurs of recognition andobsequious greetings, towards the huge circus-like erection. Thethrong thickened; the guitars tinkled louder; other horsemen satmotionless, smoking calmly above the heads of the crowd; iteddied and pushed before the doors of the high-roofed building,whence issued a shuffle and thumping of feet in time to the dancemusic vibrating and shrieking with a racking rhythm, overhung bythe tremendous, sustained, hollow roar of the gombo. Thebarbarous and imposing noise of the big drum, that can madden acrowd, and that even Europeans cannot hear without a strangeemotion, seemed to draw Nostromo on to its source, while a man,wrapped up in a faded, torn poncho, walked by his stirrup, and,buffeted right and left, begged "his worship" insistently foremployment on the wharf. He whined, offering the Senor Capatazhalf his daily pay for the privilege of being admitted to theswaggering fraternity of Cargadores; the other half would beenough for him, he protested. But Captain Mitchell's right-handman--"invaluable for our work--a perfectly incorruptiblefellow"--after looking down critically at the ragged mozo, shookhis head without a word in the uproar going on around.The man fell back; and a little further on Nostromo had to pullup. From the doors of the dance hall men and women emergedtottering, streaming with sweat, trembling in every limb, tolean, panting, with staring eyes and parted lips, against thewall of the structure, where the harps and guitars played on withmad speed in an incessant roll of thunder. Hundreds of handsclapped in there; voices shrieked, and then all at once wouldsink low, chanting in unison the refrain of a love song, with adying fall. A red flower, flung with a good aim from somewhere inthe crowd, struck the resplendent Capataz on the cheek.He caught it as it fell, neatly, but for some time did not turnhis head. When at last he condescended to look round, the throngnear him had parted to make way for a pretty Morenita, her hairheld up by a small golden comb, who was walking towards him inthe open space.Her arms and neck emerged plump and bare from a snowy chemisette;the blue woollen skirt, with all the fullness gathered in front,scanty on the hips and tight across the back, disclosed theprovoking action of her walk. She came straight on and laid herhand on the mare's neck with a timid, coquettish look upwards outof the corner of her eyes."Querido," she murmured, caressingly, "why do you pretend not tosee me when I pass?""Because I don't love thee any more," said Nostromo,deliberately, after a moment of reflective silence.The hand on the mare's neck trembled suddenly.  She dropped herhead before all the eyes in the wide circle formed round thegenerous, the terrible, the inconstant Capataz de Cargadores, andhis Morenita.Nostromo, looking down, saw tears beginning to fall down herface."Has it come, then, ever beloved of my heart?" she whispered. "Isit true?""No," said Nostromo, looking away carelessly. "It was a lie. Ilove thee as much as ever.""Is that true?" she cooed, joyously, her cheeks still wet withtears."It is true.""True on the life?""As true as that; but thou must not ask me to swear it on theMadonna that stands in thy room." And the Capataz laughed alittle in response to the grins of the crowd.She pouted--very pretty--a little uneasy."No, I will not ask for that. I can see love in your eyes." Shelaid her hand on his knee. "Why are you trembling like this? Fromlove?" she continued, while the cavernous thundering of the gombowent on without a pause. "But if you love her as much as that,you must give your Paquita a gold-mounted rosary of beads for theneck of her Madonna.""No," said Nostromo, looking into her uplifted, begging eyes,which suddenly turned stony with surprise."No? Then what else will your worship give me on the day of thefiesta?" she asked, angrily; "so as not to shame me before allthese people.""There is no shame for thee in getting nothing from thy lover foronce.""True! The shame is your worship's--my poor lover's," she flaredup, sarcastically.Laughs were heard at her anger, at her retort. What an audaciousspitfire she was! The people aware of this scene were calling outurgently to others in the crowd. The circle round the silver-greymare narrowed slowly.The girl went off a pace or two, confronting the mockingcuriosity of the eyes, then flung back to the stirrup, tiptoeing,her enraged face turned up to Nostromo with a pair of blazingeyes. He bent low to her in the saddle."Juan," she hissed, "I could stab thee to the heart!"The dreaded Capataz de Cargadores, magnificent and carelesslypublic in his amours, flung his arm round her neck and kissed herspluttering lips. A murmur went round."A knife!" he demanded at large, holding her firmly by theshoulder.Twenty blades flashed out together in the circle. A young man inholiday attire, bounding in, thrust one in Nostromo's hand andbounded back into the ranks, very proud of himself. Nostromo hadnot even looked at him."Stand on my foot," he commanded the girl, who, suddenly subdued,rose lightly, and when he had her up, encircling her waist, herface near to his, he pressed the knife into her little hand."No, Morenita! You shall not put me to shame," he said. "Youshall have your present; and so that everyone should know who isyour lover to-day, you may cut all the silver buttons off mycoat."There were shouts of laughter and applause at this witty freak,while the girl passed the keen blade, and the impassive riderjingled in his palm the increasing hoard of silver buttons. Heeased her to the ground with both her hands full. Afterwhispering for a while with a very strenuous face, she walkedaway, staring haughtily, and vanished into the crowd.The circle had broken up, and the lordly Capataz de Cargadores,the indispensable man, the tried and trusty Nostromo, theMediterranean sailor come ashore casually to try his luck inCostaguana, rode slowly towards the harbour. The Juno was justthen swinging round; and even as Nostromo reined up again to lookon, a flag ran up on the improvised flagstaff erected in anancient and dismantled little fort at the harbour entrance. Halfa battery of field guns had been hurried over there from theSulaco barracks for the purpose of firing the regulation salutesfor the President-Dictator and the War Minister. As the mail-boatheaded through the pass, the badly timed reports announced theend of Don Vincente Ribiera's first official visit to Sulaco, andfor Captain Mitchell the end of another "historic occasion." Nexttime when the "Hope of honest men" was to come that way, a yearand a half later, it was unofficially, over the mountain tracks,fleeing after a defeat on a lame mule, to be only just saved byNostromo from an ignominious death at the hands of a mob. It wasa very different event, of which Captain Mitchell used to say--"It was history--history, sir! And that fellow of mine, Nostromo,you know, was right in it. Absolutely making history, sir."But this event, creditable to Nostromo, was to lead immediatelyto another, which could not be classed either as "history" or as"a mistake" in Captain Mitchell's phraseology. He had anotherword for it."Sir" he used to say afterwards, "that was no mistake.  It was afatality. A misfortune, pure and simple, sir. And that poorfellow of mine was right in it--right in the middle of it! Afatality, if ever there was one--and to my mind he has never beenthe same man since."PART SECONDTHE ISABELSCHAPTER ONETHROUGH good and evil report in the varying fortune of thatstruggle which Don Jose had characterized in the phrase, "thefate of national honesty trembles in the balance," the GouldConcession, "Imperium in Imperio," had gone on working; thesquare mountain had gone on pouring its treasure down the woodenshoots to the unresting batteries of stamps; the lights of SanTome had twinkled night after night upon the great, limitlessshadow of the Campo; every three months the silver escort hadgone down to the sea as if neither the war nor its consequencescould ever affect the ancient Occidental State secluded beyondits high barrier of the Cordillera. All the fighting took placeon the other side of that mighty wall of serrated peaks lordedover by the white dome of Higuerota and as yet unbreached by therailway, of which only the first part, the easy Campo part fromSulaco to the Ivie Valley at the foot of the pass, had been laid.Neither did the telegraph line cross the mountains yet; itspoles, like slender beacons on the plain, penetrated into theforest fringe of the foot-hills cut by the deep avenue of thetrack; and its wire ended abruptly in the construction camp at awhite deal table supporting a Morse apparatus, in a long hut ofplanks with a corrugated iron roof overshadowed by gigantic cedartrees--the quarters of the engineer in charge of the advancesection.The harbour was busy, too, with the traffic in railway material,and with the movements of troops along the coast. The O.S.N.Company found much occupation for its fleet. Costaguana had nonavy, and, apart from a few coastguard cutters, there were nonational ships except a couple of old merchant steamers used astransports.Captain Mitchell, feeling more and more in the thick of history,found time for an hour or so during an afternoon in thedrawing-room of the Casa Gould, where, with a strange ignoranceof the real forces at work around him, he professed himselfdelighted to get away from the strain of affairs. He did not knowwhat he would have done without his invaluable Nostromo, hedeclared. Those confounded Costaguana politics gave him morework--he confided to Mrs. Gould--than he had bargained for.Don Jose Avellanos had displayed in the service of the endangeredRibiera Government an organizing activity and an eloquence ofwhich the echoes reached even Europe. For, after the new loan tothe Ribiera Government, Europe had become interested inCostaguana.  The Sala of the Provincial Assembly (in theMunicipal Buildings of Sulaco), with its portraits of theLiberators on the walls and an old flag of Cortez preserved in aglass case above the President's chair, had heard all thesespeeches--the early one containing the impassioned declaration"Militarism is the enemy," the famous one of the "tremblingbalance" delivered on the occasion of the vote for the raising ofa second Sulaco regiment in the defence of the reformingGovernment; and when the provinces again displayed their oldflags (proscribed in Guzman Bento's time) there was another ofthose great orations, when Don Jose greeted these old emblems ofthe war of Independence, brought out again in the name of newIdeals. The old idea of Federalism had disappeared. For his parthe did not wish to revive old political doctrines. They wereperishable. They died. But the doctrine of political rectitudewas immortal. The second Sulaco regiment, to whom he waspresenting this flag, was going to show its valour in a contestfor order, peace, progress; for the establishment of nationalself-respect without which--he declared with energy--"we are areproach and a byword amongst the powers of the world."Don Jose Avellanos loved his country. He had served it lavishlywith his fortune during his diplomatic career, and the laterstory of his captivity and barbarous ill-usage under Guzman Bentowas well known to his listeners. It was a wonder that he had notbeen a victim of the ferocious and summary executions whichmarked the course of that tyranny; for Guzman had ruled thecountry with the sombre imbecility of political fanaticism. Thepower of Supreme Government had become in his dull mind an objectof strange worship, as if it were some sort of cruel deity. Itwas incarnated in himself, and his adversaries, the Federalists,were the supreme sinners, objects of hate, abhorrence, and fear,as heretics would be to a convinced Inquisitor. For years he hadcarried about at the tail of the Army of Pacification, all overthe country, a captive band of such atrocious criminals, whoconsidered themselves most unfortunate at not having beensummarily executed.  It was a diminishing company of nearly nakedskeletons, loaded with irons, covered with dirt, with vermin,with raw wounds, all men of position, of education, of wealth,who had learned to fight amongst themselves for scraps of rottenbeef thrown to them by soldiers, or to beg a negro cook for adrink of muddy water in pitiful accents. Don Jose Avellanos,clanking his chains amongst the others, seemed only to exist inorder to prove how much hunger, pain, degradation, and crueltorture a human body can stand without parting with the lastspark of life. Sometimes interrogatories, backed by someprimitive method of torture, were administered to them by acommission of officers hastily assembled in a hut of sticks andbranches, and made pitiless by the fear for their own lives. Alucky one or two of that spectral company of prisoners wouldperhaps be led tottering behind a bush to be shot by a file ofsoldiers. Always an army chaplain--some unshaven, dirty man, girtwith a sword and with a tiny cross embroidered in white cotton onthe left breast of a lieutenant's uniform--would follow,cigarette in the corner of the mouth, wooden stool in hand, tohear the confession and give absolution; for the Citizen Saviourof the Country (Guzman Bento was called thus officially inpetitions) was not averse from the exercise of rational clemency.The irregular report of the firing squad would be heard, followedsometimes by a single finishing shot; a little bluish cloud ofsmoke would float up above the green bushes, and the Army ofPacification would move on over the savannas, through theforests, crossing rivers, invading rural pueblos, devastating thehaciendas of the horrid aristocrats, occupying the inland townsin the fulfilment of its patriotic mission, and leaving behind aunited land wherein the evil taint of Federalism could no longerbe detected in the smoke of burning houses and the smell of spiltblood.  Don Jose Avellanos had survived that time.  Perhaps, whencontemptuously signifying to him his release, the Citizen Saviourof the Country might have thought this benighted aristocrat toobroken in health and spirit and fortune to be any longerdangerous. Or, perhaps, it may have been a simple caprice. GuzmanBento, usually full of fanciful fears and brooding suspicions,had sudden accesses of unreasonable self-confidence when heperceived himself elevated on a pinnacle of power and safetybeyond the reach of mere mortal plotters. At such times he wouldimpulsively command the celebration of a solemn Mass ofthanksgiving, which would be sung in great pomp in the cathedralof Sta. Marta by the trembling, subservient Archbishop of hiscreation. He heard it sitting in a gilt armchair placed beforethe high altar, surrounded by the civil and military heads of hisGovernment.  The unofficial world of Sta. Marta would crowd intothe cathedral, for it was not quite safe for anybody of mark tostay away from these manifestations of presidential piety. Havingthus acknowledged the only power he was at all disposed torecognize as above himself, he would scatter acts of politicalgrace in a sardonic wantonness of clemency. There was no otherway left now to enjoy his power but by seeing his crushedadversaries crawl impotently into the light of day out of thedark, noisome cells of the Collegio. Their harmlessness fed hisinsatiable vanity, and they could always be got hold of again. Itwas the rule for all the women of their families to presentthanks afterwards in a special audience. The incarnation of thatstrange god, El Gobierno Supremo, received them standing, cockedhat on head, and exhorted them in a menacing mutter to show theirgratitude by bringing up their children in fidelity to thedemocratic form of government, "which I have established for thehappiness of our country." His front teeth having been knockedout in some accident of his former herdsman's life, his utterancewas spluttering and indistinct. He had been working forCostaguana alone in the midst of treachery and opposition.  Letit cease now lest he should become weary of forgiving!Don Jose Avellanos had known this forgiveness.He was broken in health and fortune deplorably enough to presenta truly gratifying spectacle to the supreme chief of democraticinstitutions. He retired to Sulaco. His wife had an estate inthat province, and she nursed him back to life out of the houseof death and captivity. When she died, their daughter, an onlychild, was old enough to devote herself to "poor papa."Miss Avellanos, born in Europe and educated partly in England,was a tall, grave girl, with a self-possessed manner, a wide,white forehead, a wealth of rich brown hair, and blue eyes.The other young ladies of Sulaco stood in awe of her characterand accomplishments. She was reputed to be terribly learned andserious. As to pride, it was well known that all the Corbelanswere proud, and her mother was a Corbelan. Don Jose Avellanosdepended very much upon the devotion of his beloved Antonia.  Heaccepted it in the benighted way of men, who, though made inGod's image, are like stone idols without sense before the smokeof certain burnt offerings. He was ruined in every way, but a manpossessed of passion is not a bankrupt in life. Don JoseAvellanos desired passionately for his country: peace,prosperity, and (as the end of the preface to "Fifty Years ofMisrule" has it) "an honourable place in the comity of civilizednations." In this last phrase the Minister Plenipotentiary,cruelly humiliated by the bad faith of his Government towards theforeign bondholders, stands disclosed in the patriot.The fatuous turmoil of greedy factions succeeding the tyranny ofGuzman Bento seemed to bring his desire to the very door ofopportunity. He was too old to descend personally into the centreof the arena at Sta.  Marta. But the men who acted there soughthis advice at every step. He himself thought that he could bemost useful at a distance, in Sulaco. His name, his connections,his former position, his experience commanded the respect of hisclass. The discovery that this man, living in dignified povertyin the Corbelan town residence (opposite the Casa Gould), coulddispose of material means towards the support of the causeincreased his influence. It was his open letter of appeal thatdecided the candidature of Don Vincente Ribiera for thePresidency. Another of these informal State papers drawn up byDon Jose (this time in the shape of an address from the Province)induced that scrupulous constitutionalist to accept theextraordinary powers conferred upon him for five years by anoverwhelming vote of congress in Sta. Marta. It was a specificmandate to establish the prosperity of the people on the basis offirm peace at home, and to redeem the national credit by thesatisfaction of all just claims abroad.On the afternoon the news of that vote had reached Sulaco by theusual roundabout postal way through Cayta, and up the coast bysteamer. Don Jose, who had been waiting for the mail in theGoulds' drawing-room, got out of the rocking-chair, letting hishat fall off his knees. He rubbed his silvery, short hair withboth hands, speechless with the excess of joy."Emilia, my soul," he had burst out, "let me embrace you! Letme--"Captain Mitchell, had he been there, would no doubt have made anapt remark about the dawn of a new era; but if Don Jose thoughtsomething of the kind, his eloquence failed him on this occasion.The inspirer of that revival of the Blanco party tottered wherehe stood. Mrs. Gould moved forward quickly and, as she offeredher cheek with a smile to her old friend, managed very cleverlyto give him the support of her arm he really needed.Don Jose had recovered himself at once, but for a time he coulddo no more than murmur, "Oh, you two patriots! Oh, you twopatriots!"--looking from one to the other. Vague plans of anotherhistorical work, wherein all the devotions to the regeneration ofthe country he loved would be enshrined for the reverent worshipof posterity, flitted through his mind. The historian who hadenough elevation of soul to write of Guzman Bento: "Yet thismonster, imbrued in the blood of his countrymen, must not be heldunreservedly to the execration of future years. It appears to betrue that he, too, loved his country. He had given it twelveyears of peace; and, absolute master of lives and fortunes as hewas, he died poor. His worst fault, perhaps, was not hisferocity, but his ignorance;" the man who could write thus of acruel persecutor (the passage occurs in his "History of Misrule")felt at the foreshadowing of success an almost boundlessaffection for his two helpers, for these two young people fromover the sea.Just as years ago, calmly, from the conviction of practicalnecessity, stronger than any abstract political doctrine, HenryGould had drawn the sword, so now, the times being changed,Charles Gould had flung the silver of the San Tome into the fray.The Inglez of Sulaco, the "Costaguana Englishman" of the thirdgeneration, was as far from being a political intriguer as hisuncle from a revolutionary swashbuckler. Springing from theinstinctive uprightness of their natures their action wasreasoned. They saw an opportunity and used the weapon to hand.Charles Gould's position--a commanding position in the backgroundof that attempt to retrieve the peace and the credit of theRepublic--was very clear. At the beginning he had had toaccommodate himself to existing circumstances of corruption sonaively brazen as to disarm the hate of a man courageous enoughnot to be afraid of its irresponsible potency to ruin everythingit touched. It seemed to him too contemptible for hot anger even.He made use of it with a cold, fearless scorn, manifested ratherthan concealed by the forms of stony courtesy which did away withmuch of the ignominy of the situation. At bottom, perhaps, hesuffered from it, for he was not a man of cowardly illusions, buthe refused to discuss the ethical view with his wife. He trustedthat, though a little disenchanted, she would be intelligentenough to understand that his character safeguarded theenterprise of their lives as much or more than his policy. Theextraordinary development of the mine had put a great power intohis hands. To feel that prosperity always at the mercy ofunintelligent greed had grown irksome to him. To Mrs. Gould itwas humiliating. At any rate, it was dangerous. In theconfidential communications passing between Charles Gould, theKing of Sulaco, and the head of the silver and steel interestsfar away in California, the conviction was growing that anyattempt made by men of education and integrity ought to bediscreetly supported. "You may tell your friend Avellanos that Ithink so," Mr. Holroyd had written at the proper moment from hisinviolable sanctuary within the eleven-storey high factory ofgreat affairs.  And shortly afterwards, with a credit opened bythe Third Southern Bank (located next door but one to the HolroydBuilding), the Ribierist party in Costaguana took a practicalshape under the eye of the administrator of the San Tome mine.And Don Jose, the hereditary friend of the Gould family, couldsay: "Perhaps, my dear Carlos, I shall not have believed invain."CHAPTER TWOAFTER another armed struggle, decided by Montero's victory of RioSeco, had been added to the tale of civil wars, the "honest men,"as Don Jose called them, could breathe freely for the first timein half a century. The Five-Year-Mandate law became the basis ofthat regeneration, the passionate desire and hope for which hadbeen like the elixir of everlasting youth for Don Jose Avellanos.And when it was suddenly--and not quite unexpectedly--endangeredby that "brute Montero," it was a passionate indignation thatgave him a new lease of life, as it were. Already, at the time ofthe President-Dictator's visit to Sulaco, Moraga had sounded anote of warning from Sta. Marta about the War Minister.  Monteroand his brother made the subject of an earnest talk between theDictator-President and the Nestor-inspirer of the party. But DonVincente, a doctor of philosophy from the Cordova University,seemed to have an exaggerated respect for military ability, whosemysteriousness--since it appeared to be altogether independent ofintellect--imposed upon his imagination.  The victor of Rio Secowas a popular hero. His services were so recent that thePresident-Dictator quailed before the obvious charge of politicalingratitude.  Great regenerating transactions were beinginitiated--the fresh loan, a new railway line, a vastcolonization scheme. Anything that could unsettle the publicopinion in the capital was to be avoided.  Don Jose bowed tothese arguments and tried to dismiss from his mind the gold-lacedportent in boots, and with a sabre, made meaningless now at last,he hoped, in the new order of things.Less than six months after the President-Dictator's visit, Sulacolearned with stupefaction of the military revolt in the name ofnational honour. The Minister of War, in a barrack-squareallocution to the officers of the artillery regiment he had beeninspecting, had declared the national honour sold to foreigners.The Dictator, by his weak compliance with the demands of theEuropean powers--for the settlement of long outstanding moneyclaims--had showed himself unfit to rule. A letter from Moragaexplained afterwards that the initiative, and even the very text,of the incendiary allocution came, in reality, from the otherMontero, the ex-guerillero, the Commandante de Plaza. Theenergetic treatment of Dr. Monygham, sent for in haste "to themountain," who came galloping three leagues in the dark, savedDon Jose from a dangerous attack of jaundice.After getting over the shock, Don Jose refused to let himself beprostrated. Indeed, better news succeeded at first. The revolt inthe capital had been suppressed after a night of fighting in thestreets. Unfortunately, both the Monteros had been able to maketheir escape south, to their native province of Entre-Montes. Thehero of the forest march, the victor of Rio Seco, had beenreceived with frenzied acclamations in Nicoya, the provincialcapital. The troops in garrison there had gone to him in a body.The brothers were organizing an army, gathering malcontents,sending emissaries primed with patriotic lies to the people, andwith promises of plunder to the wild llaneros. Even a Monteristpress had come into existence, speaking oracularly of the secretpromises of support given by "our great sister Republic of theNorth" against the sinister land-grabbing designs of Europeanpowers, cursing in every issue the "miserable Ribiera," who hadplotted to deliver his country, bound hand and foot, for a preyto foreign speculators.Sulaco, pastoral and sleepy, with its opulent Campo and the richsilver mine, heard the din of arms fitfully in its fortunateisolation. It was nevertheless in the very forefront of thedefence with men and money; but the very rumours reached itcircuitously--from abroad even, so much was it cut off from therest of the Republic, not only by natural obstacles, but also bythe vicissitudes of the war. The Monteristos were besiegingCayta, an important postal link. The overland couriers ceased tocome across the mountains, and no muleteer would consent to riskthe journey at last; even Bonifacio on one occasion failed toreturn from Sta. Marta, either not daring to start, or perhapscaptured by the parties of the enemy raiding the country betweenthe Cordillera and the capital. Monterist publications, however,found their way into the province, mysteriously enough; and alsoMonterist emissaries preaching death to aristocrats in thevillages and towns of the Campo. Very early, at the beginning ofthe trouble, Hernandez, the bandit, had proposed (through theagency of an old priest of a village in the wilds) to deliver twoof them to the Ribierist authorities in Tonoro. They had come tooffer him a free pardon and the rank of colonel from GeneralMontero in consideration of joining the rebel army with hismounted band. No notice was taken at the time of the proposal. Itwas joined, as an evidence of good faith, to a petition prayingthe Sulaco Assembly for permission to enlist, with all hisfollowers, in the forces being then raised in Sulaco for thedefence of the Five-Year Mandate of regeneration. The petition,like everything else, had found its way into Don Jose's hands. Hehad showed to Mrs. Gould these pages of dirty-greyish rough paper(perhaps looted in some village store), covered with the crabbed,illiterate handwriting of the old padre, carried off from his hutby the side of a mud-walled church to be the secretary of thedreaded Salteador. They had both bent in the lamplight of theGould drawing-room over the document containing the fierce andyet humble appeal of the man against the blind and stupidbarbarity turning an honest ranchero into a bandit. A postscriptof the priest stated that, but for being deprived of his libertyfor ten days, he had been treated with humanity and the respectdue to his sacred calling. He had been, it appears, confessingand absolving the chief and most of the band, and he guaranteedthe sincerity of their good disposition. He had distributed heavypenances, no doubt in the way of litanies and fasts; but heargued shrewdly that it would be difficult for them to make theirpeace with God durably till they had made peace with men.Never before, perhaps, had Hernandez's head been in less jeopardythan when he petitioned humbly for permission to buy a pardon forhimself and his gang of deserters by armed service. He couldrange afar from the waste lands protecting his fastness,unchecked, because there were no troops left in the wholeprovince.  The usual garrison of Sulaco had gone south to thewar, with its brass band playing the Bolivar march on the bridgeof one of the O.S.N. Company's steamers.  The great familycoaches drawn up along the shore of the harbour were made to rockon the high leathern springs by the enthusiasm of the senoras andthe senoritas standing up to wave their lace handkerchiefs, aslighter after lighter packed full of troops left the end of thejetty.Nostromo directed the embarkation, under the superintendendenceof Captain Mitchell, red-faced in the sun, conspicuous in a whitewaistcoat, representing the allied and anxious goodwill of allthe material interests of civilization. General Barrios, whocommanded the troops, assured Don Jose on parting that in threeweeks he would have Montero in a wooden cage drawn by three pairof oxen ready for a tour through all the towns of the Republic."And then, senora," he continued, baring his curly iron-grey headto Mrs. Gould in her landau--"and then, senora, we shall convertour swords into plough-shares and grow rich. Even I, myself, assoon as this little business is settled, shall open a fundacionon some land I have on the llanos and try to make a little moneyin peace and quietness. Senora, you know, all Costaguanaknows--what do I say?--this whole South American continent knows,that Pablo Barrios has had his fill of military glory."Charles Gould was not present at the anxious and patrioticsend-off. It was not his part to see the soldiers embark. It wasneither his part, nor his inclination, nor his policy. His part,his inclination, and his policy were united in one endeavour tokeep unchecked the flow of treasure he had started single-handedfrom the re-opened scar in the flank of the mountain. As the minedeveloped he had trained for himself some native help. There wereforemen, artificers and clerks, with Don Pepe for the gobernadorof the mining population.  For the rest his shoulders alonesustained the whole weight of the "Imperium in Imperio," thegreat Gould Concession whose mere shadow had been enough to crushthe life out of his father.Mrs. Gould had no silver mine to look after. In the general lifeof the Gould Concession she was represented by her twolieutenants, the doctor and the priest, but she fed her woman'slove of excitement on events whose significance was purified toher by the fire of her imaginative purpose. On that day she hadbrought the Avellanos, father and daughter, down to the harbourwith her.Amongst his other activities of that stirring time, Don Jose hadbecome the chairman of a Patriotic Committee which had armed agreat proportion of troops in the Sulaco command with an improvedmodel of a military rifle. It had been just discarded forsomething still more deadly by one of the great European powers.How much of the market-price for second-hand weapons was coveredby the voluntary contributions of the principal families, and howmuch came from those funds Don Jose was understood to commandabroad, remained a secret which he alone could have disclosed;but the Ricos, as the populace called them, had contributed underthe pressure of their Nestor's eloquence.  Some of the moreenthusiastic ladies had been moved to bring offerings of jewelsinto the hands of the man who was the life and soul of the party.There were moments when both his life and his soul seemedovertaxed by so many years of undiscouraged belief inregeneration. He appeared almost inanimate, sitting rigidly bythe side of Mrs. Gould in the landau, with his fine, old,clean-shaven face of a uniform tint as if modelled in yellow wax,shaded by a soft felt hat, the dark eyes looking out fixedly.Antonia, the beautiful Antonia, as Miss Avellanos was called inSulaco, leaned back, facing them; and her full figure, the graveoval of her face with full red lips, made her look more maturethan Mrs. Gould, with her mobile expression and small, erectperson under a slightly swaying sunshade.Whenever possible Antonia attended her father; her recognizeddevotion weakened the shocking effect of her scorn for the rigidconventions regulating the life of Spanish-American girlhood.And, in truth, she was no longer girlish. It was said that sheoften wrote State papers from her father's dictation, and wasallowed to read all the books in his library. At the receptions--where the situation was saved by the presence of a very decrepitold lady (a relation of the Corbelans), quite deaf and motionlessin an armchair--Antonia could hold her own in a discussion withtwo or three men at a time. Obviously she was not the girl to becontent with peeping through a barred window at a cloaked figureof a lover ensconced in a doorway opposite--which is the correctform of Costaguana courtship. It was generally believed that withher foreign upbringing and foreign ideas the learned and proudAntonia would never marry--unless, indeed, she married aforeigner from Europe or North America, now that Sulaco seemed onthe point of being invaded by all the world.CHAPTER THREEWHEN General Barrios stopped to address Mrs.  Gould, Antoniaraised negligently her hand holding an open fan, as if to shadefrom the sun her head, wrapped in a light lace shawl. The cleargleam of her blue eyes gliding behind the black fringe ofeyelashes paused for a moment upon her father, then travelledfurther to the figure of a young man of thirty at most, of mediumheight, rather thick-set, wearing a light overcoat.  Bearing downwith the open palm of his hand upon the knob of a flexible cane,he had been looking on from a distance; but directly he sawhimself noticed, he approached quietly and put his elbow over thedoor of the landau.The shirt collar, cut low in the neck, the big bow of his cravat,the style of his clothing, from the round hat to the varnishedshoes, suggested an idea of French elegance; but otherwise he wasthe very type of a fair Spanish creole. The fluffy moustache andthe short, curly, golden beard did not conceal his lips, rosy,fresh, almost pouting in expression. His full, round face was ofthat warm, healthy creole white which is never tanned by itsnative sunshine. Martin Decoud was seldom exposed to theCostaguana sun under which he was born. His people had been longsettled in Paris, where he had studied law, had dabbled inliterature, had hoped now and then in moments of exaltation tobecome a poet like that other foreigner of Spanish blood, JoseMaria Heredia. In other moments he had, to pass the time,condescended to write articles on European affairs for theSemenario, the principal newspaper in Sta. Marta, which printedthem under the heading "From our special correspondent," thoughthe authorship was an open secret. Everybody in Costaguana, wherethe tale of compatriots in Europe is jealously kept, knew that itwas "the son Decoud," a talented young man, supposed to be movingin the higher spheres of Society. As a matter of fact, he was anidle boulevardier, in touch with some smart journalists, madefree of a few newspaper offices, and welcomed in the pleasurehaunts of pressmen. This life, whose dreary superficiality iscovered by the glitter of universal blague, like the stupidclowning of a harlequin by the spangles of a motley costume,induced in him a Frenchified--but mostun-French--cosmopolitanism, in reality a mere barrenindifferentism posing as intellectual superiority. Of his owncountry he used to say to his French associates: "Imagine anatmosphere of opera-bouffe in which all the comic business ofstage statesmen, brigands, etc., etc., all their farcicalstealing, intriguing, and stabbing is done in dead earnest. It isscreamingly funny, the blood flows all the time, and the actorsbelieve themselves to be influencing the fate of the universe. Ofcourse, government in general, any government anywhere, is athing of exquisite comicality to a discerning mind; but really weSpanish-Americans do overstep the bounds. No man of ordinaryintelligence can take part in the intrigues of une farce macabre.However, these Ribierists, of whom we hear so much just now, arereally trying in their own comical way to make the countryhabitable, and even to pay some of its debts. My friends, you hadbetter write up Senor Ribiera all you can in kindness to your ownbondholders.  Really, if what I am told in my letters is true,there is some chance for them at last."And he would explain with railing verve what Don Vincente Ribierastood for--a mournful little man oppressed by his own goodintentions, the significance of battles won, who Montero was (ungrotesque vaniteux et feroce), and the manner of the new loanconnected with railway development, and the colonization of vasttracts of land in one great financial scheme.And his French friends would remark that evidently this littlefellow Decoud connaissait la question a fond.  An importantParisian review asked him for an article on the situation. It wascomposed in a serious tone and in a spirit of levity. Afterwardshe asked one of his intimates--"Have you read my thing about the regeneration of Costaguana--unebonne blague, hein?"He imagined himself Parisian to the tips of his fingers.  But farfrom being that he was in danger of remaining a sort ofnondescript dilettante all his life. He had pushed the habit ofuniversal raillery to a point where it blinded him to the genuineimpulses of his own nature.  To be suddenly selected for theexecutive member of the patriotic small-arms committee of Sulacoseemed to him the height of the unexpected, one of thosefantastic moves of which only his "dear countrymen" were capable."It's like a tile falling on my head. I--I--executive member!It's the first I hear of it! What do I know of military rifles?C'est funambulesque!" he had exclaimed to his favourite sister;for the Decoud family--except the old father and mother--usedthe French language amongst themselves. "And you should see theexplanatory and confidential letter! Eight pages of it--no less!"This letter, in Antonia's handwriting, was signed by Don Jose,who appealed to the "young and gifted Costaguanero" on publicgrounds, and privately opened his heart to his talented god-son,a man of wealth and leisure, with wide relations, and by hisparentage and bringing-up worthy of all confidence."Which means," Martin commented, cynically, to his sister, "thatI am not likely to misappropriate the funds, or go blabbing toour Charge d'Affaires here."The whole thing was being carried out behind the back of the WarMinister, Montero, a mistrusted member of the Ribiera Government,but difficult to get rid of at once. He was not to know anythingof it till the troops under Barrios's command had the new riflein their hands. The President-Dictator, whose position was verydifficult, was alone in the secret."How funny!" commented Martin's sister and confidante; to whichthe brother, with an air of best Parisian blague, had retorted:"It's immense! The idea of that Chief of the State engaged, withthe help of private citizens, in digging a mine under his ownindispensable War Minister. No!  We are unapproachable!" And helaughed immoderately.Afterwards his sister was surprised at the earnestness andability he displayed in carrying out his mission, whichcircumstances made delicate, and his want of special knowledgerendered difficult. She had never seen Martin take so muchtrouble about anything in his whole life."It amuses me," he had explained, briefly. "I am beset by a lotof swindlers trying to sell all sorts of gaspipe weapons. Theyare charming; they invite me to expensive luncheons; I keep uptheir hopes; it's extremely entertaining. Meanwhile, the realaffair is being carried through in quite another quarter."When the business was concluded he declared suddenly hisintention of seeing the precious consignment delivered safely inSulaco. The whole burlesque business, he thought, was worthfollowing up to the end.  He mumbled his excuses, tugging at hisgolden beard, before the acute young lady who (after the firstwide stare of astonishment) looked at him with narrowed eyes, andpronounced slowly--"I believe you want to see Antonia.""What Antonia?" asked the Costaguana boulevardier, in a vexed anddisdainful tone. He shrugged his shoulders, and spun round on hisheel. His sister called out after him joyously--"The Antonia you used to know when she wore her hair in twoplaits down her back."He had known her some eight years since, shortly before theAvellanos had left Europe for good, as a tall girl of sixteen,youthfully austere, and of a character already so formed that sheventured to treat slightingly his pose of disabused wisdom. Onone occasion, as though she had lost all patience, she flew outat him about the aimlessness of his life and the levity of hisopinions. He was twenty then, an only son, spoiled by his adoringfamily. This attack disconcerted him so greatly that he hadfaltered in his affectation of amused superiority before thatinsignificant chit of a school-girl.  But the impression left wasso strong that ever since all the girl friends of his sistersrecalled to him Antonia Avellanos by some faint resemblance, orby the great force of contrast. It was, he told himself, like aridiculous fatality. And, of course, in the news the Decoudsreceived regularly from Costaguana, the name of their friends,the Avellanos, cropped up frequently--the arrest and theabominable treatment of the ex-Minister, the dangers andhardships endured by the family, its withdrawal in poverty toSulaco, the death of the mother.The Monterist pronunciamento had taken place before Martin Decoudreached Costaguana. He came out in a roundabout way, throughMagellan's Straits by the main line and the West Coast Service ofthe O.S.N.  Company. His precious consignment arrived just intime to convert the first feelings of consternation into a moodof hope and resolution. Publicly he was made much of by thefamilias principales. Privately Don Jose, still shaken and weak,embraced him with tears in his eyes."You have come out yourself! No less could be expected from aDecoud. Alas! our worst fears have been realized," he moaned,affectionately. And again he hugged his god-son. This was indeedthe time for men of intellect and conscience to rally round theendangered cause.It was then that Martin Decoud, the adopted child of WesternEurope, felt the absolute change of atmosphere.  He submitted tobeing embraced and talked to without a word. He was moved inspite of himself by that note of passion and sorrow unknown onthe more refined stage of European politics. But when the tallAntonia, advancing with her light step in the dimness of the bigbare Sala of the Avellanos house, offered him her hand (in heremancipated way), and murmured, "I am glad to see you here, DonMartin," he felt how impossible it would be to tell these twopeople that he had intended to go away by the next month'spacket. Don Jose, meantime, continued his praises. Everyaccession added to public confidence, and, besides, what anexample to the young men at home from the brilliant defender ofthe country's regeneration, the worthy expounder of the party'spolitical faith before the world!  Everybody had read themagnificent article in the famous Parisian Review. The world wasnow informed:  and the author's appearance at this moment waslike a public act of faith. Young Decoud felt overcome by afeeling of impatient confusion. His plan had been to return byway of the United States through California, visit YellowstonePark, see Chicago, Niagara, have a look at Canada, perhaps make ashort stay in New York, a longer one in Newport, use his lettersof introduction. The pressure of Antonia's hand was so frank, thetone of her voice was so unexpectedly unchanged in its approvingwarmth, that all he found to say after his low bow was--"I am inexpressibly grateful for your welcome; but why need a manbe thanked for returning to his native country? I am sure DonaAntonia does not think so.""Certainly not, senor," she said, with that perfectly calmopenness of manner which characterized all her utterances. "Butwhen he returns, as you return, one may be glad--for the sake ofboth."Martin Decoud said nothing of his plans. He not only neverbreathed a word of them to any one, but only a fortnight laterasked the mistress of the Casa Gould (where he had of courseobtained admission at once), leaning forward in his chair with anair of well-bred familiarity, whether she could not detect in himthat day a marked change--an air, he explained, of more excellentgravity. At this Mrs. Gould turned her face full towards him withthe silent inquiry of slightly widened eyes and the merest ghostof a smile, an habitual movement with her, which was veryfascinating to men by something subtly devoted, finelyself-forgetful in its lively readiness of attention. Because,Decoud continued imperturbably, he felt no longer an idlecumberer of the earth. She was, he assured her, actuallybeholding at that moment the Journalist of Sulaco. At once Mrs.Gould glanced towards Antonia, posed upright in the corner of ahigh, straight-backed Spanish sofa, a large black fan wavingslowly against the curves of her fine figure, the tips of crossedfeet peeping from under the hem of the black skirt.  Decoud'seyes also remained fixed there, while in an undertone he addedthat Miss Avellanos was quite aware of his new and unexpectedvocation, which in Costaguana was generally the speciality ofhalf-educated negroes and wholly penniless lawyers. Then,confronting with a sort of urbane effrontery Mrs.  Gould's gaze,now turned sympathetically upon himself, he breathed out thewords, "Pro Patria!"What had happened was that he had all at once yielded to DonJose's pressing entreaties to take the direction of a newspaperthat would "voice the aspirations of the province." It had beenDon Jose's old and cherished idea. The necessary plant (on amodest scale) and a large consignment of paper had been receivedfrom America some time before; the right man alone was wanted.Even Senor Moraga in Sta. Marta had not been able to find one,and the matter was now becoming pressing; some organ wasabsolutely needed to counteract the effect of the liesdisseminated by the Monterist press: the atrocious calumnies, theappeals to the people calling upon them to rise with their knivesin their hands and put an end once for all to the Blancos, tothese Gothic remnants, to these sinister mummies, these impotentparaliticos, who plotted with foreigners for the surrender of thelands and the slavery of the people.The clamour of this Negro Liberalism frightened Senor Avellanos.A newspaper was the only remedy.  And now that the right man hadbeen found in Decoud, great black letters appeared paintedbetween the windows above the arcaded ground floor of a house onthe Plaza. It was next to Anzani's great emporium of boots,silks, ironware, muslins, wooden toys, tiny silver arms, legs,heads, hearts (for ex-voto offerings), rosaries, champagne,women's hats, patent medicines, even a few dusty books in papercovers and mostly in the French language. The big black lettersformed the words, "Offices of the Porvenir." From these offices asingle folded sheet of Martin's journalism issued three times aweek; and the sleek yellow Anzani prowling in a suit of ampleblack and carpet slippers, before the many doors of hisestablishment, greeted by a deep, side-long inclination of hisbody the Journalist of Sulaco going to and fro on the business ofhis august calling.CHAPTER FOURPERHAPS it was in the exercise of his calling that he had come tosee the troops depart. The Porvenir of the day after next wouldno doubt relate the event, but its editor, leaning his sideagainst the landau, seemed to look at nothing. The front rank ofthe company of infantry drawn up three deep across the shore endof the jetty when pressed too close would bring their bayonets tothe charge ferociously, with an awful rattle; and then the crowdof spectators swayed back bodily, even under the noses of the bigwhite mules. Notwithstanding the great multitude there was only alow, muttering noise; the dust hung in a brown haze, in which thehorsemen, wedged in the throng here and there, towered from thehips upwards, gazing all one way over the heads. Almost every oneof them had mounted a friend, who steadied himself with bothhands grasping his shoulders from behind; and the rims of theirhats touching, made like one disc sustaining the cones of twopointed crowns with a double face underneath. A hoarse mozo wouldbawl out something to an acquaintance in the ranks, or a womanwould shriek suddenly the word Adios!  followed by the Christianname of a man.General Barrios, in a shabby blue tunic and white peg-toptrousers falling upon strange red boots, kept his head uncoveredand stooped slightly, propping himself up with a thick stick. No!He had earned enough military glory to satiate any man, heinsisted to Mrs.  Gould, trying at the same time to put an air ofgallantry into his attitude. A few jetty hairs hung sparsely fromhis upper lip, he had a salient nose, a thin, long jaw, and ablack silk patch over one eye. His other eye, small and deep-set,twinkled erratically in all directions, aimlessly affable. Thefew European spectators, all men, who had naturally drifted intothe neighbourhood of the Gould carriage, betrayed by thesolemnity of their faces their impression that the general musthave had too much punch (Swedish punch, imported in bottles byAnzani) at the Amarilla Club before he had started with his Staffon a furious ride to the harbour. But Mrs.  Gould bent forward,self-possessed, and declared her conviction that still more gloryawaited the general in the near future."Senora!" he remonstrated, with great feeling, "in the name ofGod, reflect! How can there be any glory for a man like me inovercoming that bald-headed embustero with the dyed moustaches?"Pablo Ignacio Barrios, son of a village alcalde, general ofdivision, commanding in chief the Occidental Military district,did not frequent the higher society of the town. He preferred theunceremonious gatherings of men where he could tell jaguar-huntstories, boast of his powers with the lasso, with which he couldperform extremely difficult feats of the sort "no married manshould attempt," as the saying goes amongst the llaneros; relatetales of extraordinary night rides, encounters with wild bulls,struggles with crocodiles, adventures in the great forests,crossings of swollen rivers. And it was not mere boastfulnessthat prompted the general's reminiscences, but a genuine love ofthat wild life which he had led in his young days before heturned his back for ever on the thatched roof of the parentaltolderia in the woods. Wandering away as far as Mexico he hadfought against the French by the side (as he said) of Juarez, andwas the only military man of Costaguana who had ever encounteredEuropean troops in the field. That fact shed a great lustre uponhis name till it became eclipsed by the rising star of Montero.All his life he had been an inveterate gambler.  He alludedhimself quite openly to the current story how once, during somecampaign (when in command of a brigade), he had gambled away hishorses, pistols, and accoutrements, to the very epaulettes,playing monte with his colonels the night before the battle.Finally, he had sent under escort his sword (a presentationsword, with a gold hilt) to the town in the rear of his positionto be immediately pledged for five hundred pesetas with a sleepyand frightened shop-keeper. By daybreak he had lost the last ofthat money, too, when his only remark, as he rose calmly, was,"Now let us go and fight to the death." From that time he hadbecome aware that a general could lead his troops into battlevery well with a simple stick in his hand. "It has been my customever since," he would say.He was always overwhelmed with debts; even during the periods ofsplendour in his varied fortunes of a Costaguana general, when heheld high military commands, his gold-laced uniforms were almostalways in pawn with some tradesman. And at last, to avoid theincessant difficulties of costume caused by the anxious lenders,he had assumed a disdain of military trappings, an eccentricfashion of shabby old tunics, which had become like a secondnature. But the faction Barrios joined needed to fear nopolitical betrayal. He was too much of a real soldier for theignoble traffic of buying and selling victories. A member of theforeign diplomatic body in Sta. Marta had once passed a judgmentupon him: "Barrios is a man of perfect honesty and even of sometalent for war, mais il manque de tenue." After the triumph ofthe Ribierists he had obtained the reputedly lucrative Occidentalcommand, mainly through the exertions of his creditors (the Sta.Marta shopkeepers, all great politicians), who moved heaven andearth in his interest publicly, and privately besieged SenorMoraga, the influential agent of the San Tome mine, with theexaggerated lamentations that if the general were passed over,"We shall all be ruined." An incidental but favourable mention ofhis name in Mr. Gould senior's long correspondence with his sonhad something to do with his appointment, too; but most of allundoubtedly his established political honesty. No one questionedthe personal bravery of the Tiger-killer, as the populace calledhim. He was, however, said to be unlucky in the field--but thiswas to be the beginning of an era of peace. The soldiers likedhim for his humane temper, which was like a strange and preciousflower unexpectedly blooming on the hotbed of corruptrevolutions; and when he rode slowly through the streets duringsome military display, the contemptuous good humour of hissolitary eye roaming over the crowds extorted the acclamations ofthe populace. The women of that class especially seemedpositively fascinated by the long drooping nose, the peaked chin,the heavy lower lip, the black silk eyepatch and band slantingrakishly over the forehead.  His high rank always procured anaudience of Caballeros for his sporting stories, which hedetailed very well with a simple, grave enjoyment. As to thesociety of ladies, it was irksome by the restraints it imposedwithout any equivalent, as far as he could see. He had not,perhaps, spoken three times on the whole to Mrs.  Gould since hehad taken up his high command; but he had observed her frequentlyriding with the Senor Administrador, and had pronounced thatthere was more sense in her little bridle-hand than in all thefemale heads in Sulaco. His impulse had been to be very civil onparting to a woman who did not wobble in the saddle, and happenedto be the wife of a personality very important to a man alwaysshort of money. He even pushed his attentions so far as to desirethe aide-de-camp at his side (a thick-set, short captain with aTartar physiognomy) to bring along a corporal with a file of menin front of the carriage, lest the crowd in its backward surgesshould "incommode the mules of the senora." Then, turning to thesmall knot of silent Europeans looking on within earshot, heraised his voice protectingly--"Senores, have no apprehension. Go on quietly making your FerroCarril--your railways, your telegraphs.  Your--There's enoughwealth in Costaguana to pay for everything--or else you would notbe here. Ha! ha! Don't mind this little picardia of my friendMontero. In a little while you shall behold his dyed moustachesthrough the bars of a strong wooden cage. Si, senores! Fearnothing, develop the country, work, work!"The little group of engineers received this exhortation without aword, and after waving his hand at them loftily, he addressedhimself again to Mrs. Gould--"That is what Don Jose says we must do. Be enterprising!  Work!Grow rich! To put Montero in a cage is my work; and when thatinsignificant piece of business is done, then, as Don Jose wishesus, we shall grow rich, one and all, like so many Englishmen,because it is money that saves a country, and--"But a young officer in a very new uniform, hurrying up from thedirection of the jetty, interrupted his interpretation of SenorAvellanos's ideals. The general made a movement of impatience;the other went on talking to him insistently, with an air ofrespect. The horses of the Staff had been embarked, the steamer'sgig was awaiting the general at the boat steps; and Barrios,after a fierce stare of his one eye, began to take leave. DonJose roused himself for an appropriate phrase pronouncedmechanically. The terrible strain of hope and fear was telling onhim, and he seemed to husband the last sparks of his fire forthose oratorical efforts of which even the distant Europe was tohear.  Antonia, her red lips firmly closed, averted her headbehind the raised fan; and young Decoud, though he felt thegirl's eyes upon him, gazed away persistently, hooked on hiselbow, with a scornful and complete detachment.  Mrs. Gouldheroically concealed her dismay at the appearance of men andevents so remote from her racial conventions, dismay too deep tobe uttered in words even to her husband. She understood hisvoiceless reserve better now. Their confidential intercoursefell, not in moments of privacy, but precisely in public, whenthe quick meeting of their glances would comment upon some freshturn of events. She had gone to his school of uncompromisingsilence, the only one possible, since so much that seemedshocking, weird, and grotesque in the working out of theirpurposes had to be accepted as normal in this country.Decidedly, the stately Antonia looked more mature and infinitelycalm; but she would never have known how to reconcile the suddensinkings of her heart with an amiable mobility of expression.Mrs. Gould smiled a good-bye at Barrios, nodded round to theEuropeans (who raised their hats simultaneously) with an engaginginvitation, "I hope to see you all presently, at home"; then saidnervously to Decoud, "Get in, Don Martin," and heard him mutterto himself in French, as he opened the carriage door, "Le sort enest jete." She heard him with a sort of exasperation. Nobodyought to have known better than himself that the first cast ofdice had been already thrown long ago in a most desperate game.Distant acclamations, words of command yelled out, and a roll ofdrums on the jetty greeted the departing general.  Something likea slight faintness came over her, and she looked blankly atAntonia's still face, wondering what would happen to Charley ifthat absurd man failed.  "A la casa, Ignacio," she cried at themotionless broad back of the coachman, who gathered the reinswithout haste, mumbling to himself under his breath, "Si, lacasa. Si, si nina."The carriage rolled noiselessly on the soft track, the shadowsfell long on the dusty little plain interspersed with darkbushes, mounds of turned-up earth, low wooden buildings with ironroofs of the Railway Company; the sparse row of telegraph polesstrode obliquely clear of the town, bearing a single, almostinvisible wire far into the great campo--like a slender,vibrating feeler of that progress waiting outside for a moment ofpeace to enter and twine itself about the weary heart of theland.The cafe window of the Albergo d'ltalia Una was full of sunburnt,whiskered faces of railway men. But at the other end of thehouse, the end of the Signori Inglesi, old Giorgio, at the doorwith one of his girls on each side, bared his bushy head, aswhite as the snows of Higuerota. Mrs. Gould stopped the carriage.She seldom failed to speak to her protege; moreover, theexcitement, the heat, and the dust had made her thirsty. Sheasked for a glass of water. Giorgio sent the children indoors forit, and approached with pleasure expressed in his whole ruggedcountenance. It was not often that he had occasion to see hisbenefactress, who was also an Englishwoman--another title to hisregard. He offered some excuses for his wife. It was a bad daywith her; her oppressions--he tapped his own broad chest. Shecould not move from her chair that day.Decoud, ensconced in the corner of his seat, observed gloomilyMrs. Gould's old revolutionist, then, offhand--"Well, and what do you think of it all, Garibaldino?"Old Giorgio, looking at him with some curiosity, said civillythat the troops had marched very well. One-eyed Barrios and hisofficers had done wonders with the recruits in a short time.Those Indios, only caught the other day, had gone swinging pastin double quick time, like bersaglieri; they looked well fed,too, and had whole uniforms. "Uniforms!" he repeated with ahalf-smile of pity. A look of grim retrospect stole over hispiercing, steady eyes. It had been otherwise in his time when menfought against tyranny, in the forests of Brazil, or on theplains of Uruguay, starving on half-raw beef without salt, halfnaked, with often only a knife tied to a stick for a weapon. "Andyet we used to prevail against the oppressor," he concluded,proudly.His animation fell; the slight gesture of his hand expresseddiscouragement; but he added that he had asked one of thesergeants to show him the new rifle.  There was no such weapon inhis fighting days; and if Barrios could not--"Yes, yes," broke in Don Jose, almost trembling with eagerness."We are safe. The good Senor Viola is a man of experience.Extremely deadly--is it not so? You have accomplished yourmission admirably, my dear Martin."Decoud, lolling back moodily, contemplated old Viola."Ah! Yes. A man of experience. But who are you for, really, inyour heart?"Mrs. Gould leaned over to the children. Linda had brought out aglass of water on a tray, with extreme care; Giselle presentedher with a bunch of flowers gathered hastily."For the people," declared old Viola, sternly."We are all for the people--in the end.""Yes," muttered old Viola, savagely. "And meantime they fight foryou. Blind. Esclavos!"At that moment young Scarfe of the railway staff emerged from thedoor of the part reserved for the Signori Inglesi. He had comedown to headquarters from somewhere up the line on a lightengine, and had had just time to get a bath and change hisclothes. He was a nice boy, and Mrs. Gould welcomed him."It's a delightful surprise to see you, Mrs. Gould.  I've justcome down. Usual luck. Missed everything, of course. This show isjust over, and I hear there has been a great dance at Don JusteLopez's last night. Is it true?""The young patricians," Decoud began suddenly in his preciseEnglish, "have indeed been dancing before they started off to thewar with the Great Pompey."Young Scarfe stared, astounded. "You haven't met before," Mrs.Gould intervened. "Mr. Decoud--Mr. Scarfe.""Ah! But we are not going to Pharsalia," protested Don Jose, withnervous haste, also in English.  "You should not jest like this,Martin."Antonia's breast rose and fell with a deeper breath.  The youngengineer was utterly in the dark. "Great what?" he muttered,vaguely."Luckily, Montero is not a Caesar," Decoud continued.  "Not thetwo Monteros put together would make a decent parody of aCaesar." He crossed his arms on his breast, looking at SenorAvellanos, who had returned to his immobility. "It is only you,Don Jose, who are a genuine old Roman--vir Romanus--eloquent andinflexible."Since he had heard the name of Montero pronounced, young Scarfehad been eager to express his simple feelings.  In a loud andyouthful tone he hoped that this Montero was going to be lickedonce for all and done with. There was no saying what would happento the railway if the revolution got the upper hand. Perhaps itwould have to be abandoned. It would not be the first railwaygone to pot in Costaguana. "You know, it's one of their so-callednational things," he ran on, wrinkling up his nose as if the wordhad a suspicious flavour to his profound experience of SouthAmerican affairs. And, of course, he chatted with animation, ithad been such an immense piece of luck for him at his age to getappointed on the staff "of a big thing like that--don't youknow." It would give him the pull over a lot of chaps all throughlife, he asserted. "Therefore--down with Montero! Mrs. Gould."His artless grin disappeared slowly before the unanimous gravityof the faces turned upon him from the carriage; only that "oldchap," Don Jose, presenting a motionless, waxy profile, staredstraight on as if deaf. Scarfe did not know the Avellanos verywell. They did not give balls, and Antonia never appeared at aground-floor window, as some other young ladies used to doattended by elder women, to chat with the caballeros on horsebackin the Calle. The stares of these creoles did not matter much;but what on earth had come to Mrs.  Gould? She said, "Go on,Ignacio," and gave him a slow inclination of the head. He heard ashort laugh from that round-faced, Frenchified fellow. Hecoloured up to the eyes, and stared at Giorgio Viola, who hadfallen back with the children, hat in hand."I shall want a horse presently," he said with some asperity tothe old man."Si, senor. There are plenty of horses," murmured theGaribaldino, smoothing absently, with his brown hands, the twoheads, one dark with bronze glints, the other fair with a copperyripple, of the two girls by his side. The returning stream ofsightseers raised a great dust on the road. Horsemen noticed thegroup.  "Go to your mother," he said. "They are growing up as Iam growing older, and there is nobody--"He looked at the young engineer and stopped, as if awakened froma dream; then, folding his arms on his breast, took up his usualposition, leaning back in the doorway with an upward glancefastened on the white shoulder of Higuerota far away.In the carriage Martin Decoud, shifting his position as though hecould not make himself comfortable, muttered as he swayed towardsAntonia, "I suppose you hate me." Then in a loud voice he beganto congratulate Don Jose upon all the engineers being convincedRibierists. The interest of all those foreigners was gratifying."You have heard this one. He is an enlightened well-wisher. It ispleasant to think that the prosperity of Costaguana is of someuse to the world.""He is very young," Mrs. Gould remarked, quietly."And so very wise for his age," retorted Decoud.  "But here wehave the naked truth from the mouth of that child. You are right,Don Jose. The natural treasures of Costaguana are of importanceto the progressive Europe represented by this youth, just asthree hundred years ago the wealth of our Spanish fathers was aserious object to the rest of Europe--as represented by the boldbuccaneers. There is a curse of futility upon our character: DonQuixote and Sancho Panza, chivalry and materialism, high-soundingsentiments and a supine morality, violent efforts for an idea anda sullen acquiescence in every form of corruption.  We convulseda continent for our independence only to become the passive preyof a democratic parody, the helpless victims of scoundrels andcut-throats, our institutions a mockery, our laws a farce--aGuzman Bento our master! And we have sunk so low that when a manlike you has awakened our conscience, a stupid barbarian of aMontero--Great Heavens! a Montero!--becomes a deadly danger, andan ignorant, boastful Indio, like Barrios, is our defender."But Don Jose, disregarding the general indictment as though hehad not heard a word of it, took up the defence of Barrios. Theman was competent enough for his special task in the plan ofcampaign. It consisted in an offensive movement, with Cayta asbase, upon the flank of the Revolutionist forces advancing fromthe south against Sta. Marta, which was covered by another armywith the President-Dictator in its midst. Don Jose became quiteanimated with a great flow of speech, bending forward anxiouslyunder the steady eyes of his daughter. Decoud, as if silenced byso much ardour, did not make a sound. The bells of the city werestriking the hour of Oracion when the carriage rolled under theold gateway facing the harbour like a shapeless monument ofleaves and stones. The rumble of wheels under the sonorous archwas traversed by a strange, piercing shriek, and Decoud, from hisback seat, had a view of the people behind the carriage trudgingalong the road outside, all turning their heads, in sombreros andrebozos, to look at a locomotive which rolled quickly out ofsight behind Giorgio Viola's house, under a white trail of steamthat seemed to vanish in the breathless, hysterically prolongedscream of warlike triumph. And it was all like a fleeting vision,the shrieking ghost of a railway engine fleeing across the frameof the archway, behind the startled movement of the peoplestreaming back from a military spectacle with silent footsteps onthe dust of the road. It was a material train returning from theCampo to the palisaded yards. The empty cars rolled lightly onthe single track; there was no rumble of wheels, no tremor of theground.   The engine-driver, running past the Casa Viola with thesalute of an uplifted arm, checked his speed smartly beforeentering the yard; and when the ear-splitting screech of thesteam-whistle for the brakes had stopped, a series of hard,battering shocks, mingled with the clanking of chain-couplings,made a tumult of blows and shaken fetters under the vault of thegate.CHAPTER FIVETHE Gould carriage was the first to return from the harbour tothe empty town. On the ancient pavement, laid out in patterns,sunk into ruts and holes, the portly Ignacio, mindful of thesprings of the Parisian-built landau, had pulled up to a walk,and Decoud in his corner contemplated moodily the inner aspect ofthe gate. The squat turreted sides held up between them a mass ofmasonry with bunches of grass growing at the top, and a grey,heavily scrolled, armorial shield of stone above the apex of thearch with the arms of Spain nearly smoothed out as if inreadiness for some new device typical of the impending progress.The explosive noise of the railway trucks seemed to augmentDecoud's irritation. He muttered something to himself, then beganto talk aloud in curt, angry phrases thrown at the silence of thetwo women. They did not look at him at all; while Don Jose, withhis semi-translucent, waxy complexion, overshadowed by the softgrey hat, swayed a little to the jolts of the carriage by theside of Mrs. Gould."This sound puts a new edge on a very old truth."Decoud spoke in French, perhaps because of Ignacio on the boxabove him; the old coachman, with his broad back filling a short,silver-braided jacket, had a big pair of ears, whose thick rimsstood well away from his cropped head."Yes, the noise outside the city wall is new, but the principleis old."He ruminated his discontent for a while, then began afresh with asidelong glance at Antonia--"No, but just imagine our forefathers in morions and corseletsdrawn up outside this gate, and a band of adventurers just landedfrom their ships in the harbour there. Thieves, of course.Speculators, too. Their expeditions, each one, were thespeculations of grave and reverend persons in England. That ishistory, as that absurd sailor Mitchell is always saying.""Mitchell's arrangements for the embarkation of the troops wereexcellent!" exclaimed Don Jose."That!--that! oh, that's really the work of that Genoese seaman!But to return to my noises; there used to be in the old days thesound of trumpets outside that gate. War trumpets! I'm sure theywere trumpets.  I have read somewhere that Drake, who was thegreatest of these men, used to dine alone in his cabin on boardship to the sound of trumpets. In those days this town was fullof wealth. Those men came to take it. Now the whole land is likea treasure-house, and all these people are breaking into it,whilst we are cutting each other's throats. The only thing thatkeeps them out is mutual jealousy. But they'll come to anagreement some day--and by the time we've settled our quarrelsand become decent and honourable, there'll be nothing left forus. It has always been the same. We are a wonderful people, butit has always been our fate to be"--he did not say "robbed," butadded, after a pause--"exploited!"Mrs. Gould said, "Oh, this is unjust!" And Antonia interjected,"Don't answer him, Emilia. He is attacking me.""You surely do not think I was attacking Don Carlos!" Decoudanswered.And then the carriage stopped before the door of the Casa Gould.The young man offered his hand to the ladies. They went in firsttogether; Don Jose walked by the side of Decoud, and the goutyold porter tottered after them with some light wraps on his arm.Don Jose slipped his hand under the arm of the journalist ofSulaco."The Porvenir must have a long and confident article upon Barriosand the irresistibleness of his army of Cayta! The moral effectshould be kept up in the country. We must cable encouragingextracts to Europe and the United States to maintain a favourableimpression abroad."Decoud muttered, "Oh, yes, we must comfort our friends, thespeculators."The long open gallery was in shadow, with its screen of plants invases along the balustrade, holding out motionless blossoms, andall the glass doors of the reception-rooms thrown open. A jingleof spurs died out at the further end.Basilio, standing aside against the wall, said in a soft tone tothe passing ladies, "The Senor Administrador is just back fromthe mountain."In the great sala, with its groups of ancient Spanish and modernEuropean furniture making as if different centres under the highwhite spread of the ceiling, the silver and porcelain of thetea-service gleamed among a cluster of dwarf chairs, like a bitof a lady's boudoir, putting in a note of feminine and intimatedelicacy.Don Jose in his rocking-chair placed his hat on his lap, andDecoud walked up and down the whole length of the room, passingbetween tables loaded with knick-knacks and almost disappearingbehind the high backs of leathern sofas. He was thinking of theangry face of Antonia; he was confident that he would make hispeace with her. He had not stayed in Sulaco to quarrel withAntonia.Martin Decoud was angry with himself. All he saw and heard goingon around him exasperated the preconceived views of his Europeancivilization. To contemplate revolutions from the distance of theParisian Boulevards was quite another matter. Here on the spot itwas not possible to dismiss their tragic comedy with theexpression, "Quelle farce!"The reality of the political action, such as it was, seemedcloser, and acquired poignancy by Antonia's belief in the cause.Its crudeness hurt his feelings. He was surprised at his ownsensitiveness."I suppose I am more of a Costaguanero than I would have believedpossible," he thought to himself.His disdain grew like a reaction of his scepticism against theaction into which he was forced by his infatuation for Antonia.He soothed himself by saying he was not a patriot, but a lover.The ladies came in bareheaded, and Mrs. Gould sank low before thelittle tea-table. Antonia took up her usual place at thereception hour--the corner of a leathern couch, with a rigidgrace in her pose and a fan in her hand. Decoud, swerving fromthe straight line of his march, came to lean over the high backof her seat.For a long time he talked into her ear from behind, softly, witha half smile and an air of apologetic familiarity.  Her fan layhalf grasped on her knees. She never looked at him. His rapidutterance grew more and more insistent and caressing. At last heventured a slight laugh."No, really. You must forgive me. One must be serious sometimes."He paused. She turned her head a little; her blue eyes glidedslowly towards him, slightly upwards, mollified and questioning."You can't think I am serious when I call Montero a gran' bestiaevery second day in the Porvenir? That is not a seriousoccupation. No occupation is serious, not even when a bulletthrough the heart is the penalty of failure!"Her hand closed firmly on her fan."Some reason, you understand, I mean some sense, may creep intothinking; some glimpse of truth. I mean some effective truth, forwhich there is no room in politics or journalism. I happen tohave said what I thought. And you are angry! If you do me thekindness to think a little you will see that I spoke like apatriot."She opened her red lips for the first time, not unkindly."Yes, but you never see the aim. Men must be used as they are. Isuppose nobody is really disinterested, unless, perhaps, you, DonMartin.""God forbid! It's the last thing I should like you to believe ofme." He spoke lightly, and paused.She began to fan herself with a slow movement without raising herhand. After a time he whispered passionately--"Antonia!"She smiled, and extended her hand after the English mannertowards Charles Gould, who was bowing before her; while Decoud,with his elbows spread on the back of the sofa, dropped his eyesand murmured, "Bonjour."The Senor Administrador of the San Tome mine bent over his wifefor a moment. They exchanged a few words, of which only thephrase, "The greatest enthusiasm," pronounced by Mrs. Gould,could be heard."Yes," Decoud began in a murmur. "Even he!""This is sheer calumny," said Antonia, not very severely."You just ask him to throw his mine into the melting-pot for thegreat cause," Decoud whispered.Don Jose had raised his voice. He rubbed his hands cheerily. Theexcellent aspect of the troops and the great quantity of newdeadly rifles on the shoulders of those brave men seemed to fillhim with an ecstatic confidence.Charles Gould, very tall and thin before his chair, listened, butnothing could be discovered in his face except a kind anddeferential attention.Meantime, Antonia had risen, and, crossing the room, stoodlooking out of one of the three long windows giving on thestreet. Decoud followed her. The window was thrown open, and heleaned against the thickness of the wall. The long folds of thedamask curtain, falling straight from the broad brass cornice,hid him partly from the room. He folded his arms on his breast,and looked steadily at Antonia's profile.The people returning from the harbour filled the pavements; theshuffle of sandals and a low murmur of voices ascended to thewindow. Now and then a coach rolled slowly along the disjointedroadway of the Calle de la Constitucion. There were not manyprivate carriages in Sulaco; at the most crowded hour on theAlameda they could be counted with one glance of the eye. Thegreat family arks swayed on high leathern springs, full of prettypowdered faces in which the eyes looked intensely alive andblack. And first Don Juste Lopez, the President of the ProvincialAssembly, passed with his three lovely daughters, solemn in ablack frock-coat and stiff white tie, as when directing a debatefrom a high tribune. Though they all raised their eyes, Antoniadid not make the usual greeting gesture of a fluttered hand, andthey affected not to see the two young people, Costaguaneros withEuropean manners, whose eccentricities were discussed behind thebarred windows of the first families in Sulaco. And then thewidowed Senora Gavilaso de Valdes rolled by, handsome anddignified, in a great machine in which she used to travel to andfrom her country house, surrounded by an armed retinue in leathersuits and big sombreros, with carbines at the bows of theirsaddles.  She was a woman of most distinguished family, proud,rich, and kind-hearted. Her second son, Jaime, had just gone offon the Staff of Barrios. The eldest, a worthless fellow of amoody disposition, filled Sulaco with the noise of hisdissipations, and gambled heavily at the club. The two youngestboys, with yellow Ribierist cockades in their caps, sat on thefront seat.  She, too, affected not to see the Senor Decoudtalking publicly with Antonia in defiance of every convention.And he not even her novio as far as the world knew!  Though, evenin that case, it would have been scandal enough. But thedignified old lady, respected and admired by the first families,would have been still more shocked if she could have heard thewords they were exchanging."Did you say I lost sight of the aim? I have only one aim in theworld."She made an almost imperceptible negative movement of her head,still staring across the street at the Avellanos's house, grey,marked with decay, and with iron bars like a prison."And it would be so easy of attainment," he continued, "this aimwhich, whether knowingly or not, I have always had in myheart--ever since the day when you snubbed me so horribly once inParis, you remember."A slight smile seemed to move the corner of the lip that was onhis side."You know you were a very terrible person, a sort of CharlotteCorday in a schoolgirl's dress; a ferocious patriot. I supposeyou would have stuck a knife into Guzman Bento?"She interrupted him. "You do me too much honour.""At any rate," he said, changing suddenly to a tone of bitterlevity, "you would have sent me to stab him without compunction.""Ah, par exemple!" she murmured in a shocked tone."Well," he argued, mockingly, "you do keep me here writing deadlynonsense. Deadly to me! It has already killed my self-respect.And you may imagine," he continued, his tone passing into lightbanter, "that Montero, should he be successful, would get evenwith me in the only way such a brute can get even with a man ofintelligence who condescends to call him a gran' bestia threetimes a week. It's a sort of intellectual death; but there is theother one in the background for a journalist of my ability.""If he is successful!" said Antonia, thoughtfully."You seem satisfied to see my life hang on a thread," Decoudreplied, with a broad smile. "And the other Montero, the 'mytrusted brother' of the proclamations, the guerrillero--haven't Iwritten that he was taking the guests' overcoats and changingplates in Paris at our Legation in the intervals of spying on ourrefugees there, in the time of Rojas? He will wash out thatsacred truth in blood. In my blood! Why do you look annoyed? Thisis simply a bit of the biography of one of our great men. What doyou think he will do to me? There is a certain convent wall roundthe corner of the Plaza, opposite the door of the Bull Ring. Youknow? Opposite the door with the inscription, Intrada de laSombra.' Appropriate, perhaps! That's where the uncle of our hostgave up his Anglo-South-American soul. And, note, he might haverun away. A man who has fought with weapons may run away. Youmight have let me go with Barrios if you had cared for me. Iwould have carried one of those rifles, in which Don Josebelieves, with the greatest satisfaction, in the ranks of poorpeons and Indios, that know nothing either of reason or politics.The most forlorn hope in the most forlorn army on earth wouldhave been safer than that for which you made me stay here. Whenyou make war you may retreat, but not when you spend your time ininciting poor ignorant fools to kill and to die."His tone remained light, and as if unaware of his presence shestood motionless, her hands clasped lightly, the fan hanging downfrom her interlaced fingers. He waited for a while, and then--"I shall go to the wall," he said, with a sort of joculardesperation.Even that declaration did not make her look at him.  Her headremained still, her eyes fixed upon the house of the Avellanos,whose chipped pilasters, broken cornices, the whole degradationof dignity was hidden now by the gathering dusk of the street. Inher whole figure her lips alone moved, forming the words--"Martin, you will make me cry."He remained silent for a minute, startled, as if overwhelmed by asort of awed happiness, with the lines of the mocking smile stillstiffened about his mouth, and incredulous surprise in his eyes.The value of a sentence is in the personality which utters it,for nothing new can be said by man or woman; and those were thelast words, it seemed to him, that could ever have been spoken byAntonia. He had never made it up with her so completely in alltheir intercourse of small encounters; but even before she hadtime to turn towards him, which she did slowly with a rigidgrace, he had begun to plead--"My sister is only waiting to embrace you. My father istransported with joy. I won't say anything of my mother! Ourmothers were like sisters. There is the mail-boat for the southnext week--let us go.  That Moraga is a fool! A man like Monterois bribed. It's the practice of the country. It's tradition--it's politics. Read 'Fifty Years of Misrule.'""Leave poor papa alone, Don Martin. He believes--""I have the greatest tenderness for your father," he began,hurriedly. "But I love you, Antonia! And Moraga has miserablymismanaged this business. Perhaps your father did, too; I don'tknow. Montero was bribeable. Why, I suppose he only wanted hisshare of this famous loan for national development. Why didn'tthe stupid Sta. Marta people give him a mission to Europe, orsomething? He would have taken five years' salary in advance, andgone on loafing in Paris, this stupid, ferocious Indio!""The man," she said, thoughtfully, and very calm before thisoutburst, "was intoxicated with vanity.  We had all theinformation, not from Moraga only; from others, too. There washis brother intriguing, too.""Oh, yes!" he said. "Of course you know. You know everything. Youread all the correspondence, you write all the papers--all thoseState papers that are inspired here, in this room, in blinddeference to a theory of political purity. Hadn't you CharlesGould before your eyes? Rey de Sulaco! He and his mine are thepractical demonstration of what could have been done. Do youthink he succeeded by his fidelity to a theory of virtue? And allthose railway people, with their honest work! Of course, theirwork is honest! But what if you cannot work honestly till thethieves are satisfied? Could he not, a gentleman, have told thisSir John what's-his-name that Montero had to be bought off--heand all his Negro Liberals hanging on to his gold-laced sleeve?He ought to have been bought off with his own stupid weight ofgold--his weight of gold, I tell you, boots, sabre, spurs, cockedhat, and all."She shook her head slightly. "It was impossible," she murmured."He wanted the whole lot? What?"She was facing him now in the deep recess of the window, veryclose and motionless. Her lips moved rapidly. Decoud, leaning hisback against the wall, listened with crossed arms and loweredeyelids. He drank the tones of her even voice, and watched theagitated life of her throat, as if waves of emotion had run fromher heart to pass out into the air in her reasonable words. Healso had his aspirations, he aspired to carry her away out ofthese deadly futilities of pronunciamientos and reforms. All thiswas wrong--utterly wrong; but she fascinated him, and sometimesthe sheer sagacity of a phrase would break the charm, replace thefascination by a sudden unwilling thrill of interest. Some womenhovered, as it were, on the threshold of genius, he reflected.They did not want to know, or think, or understand. Passion stoodfor all that, and he was ready to believe that some startlinglyprofound remark, some appreciation of character, or a judgmentupon an event, bordered on the miraculous.  In the mature Antoniahe could see with an extraordinary vividness the austereschoolgirl of the earlier days. She seduced his attention;sometimes he could not restrain a murmur of assent; now and thenhe advanced an objection quite seriously. Gradually they began toargue; the curtain half hid them from the people in the sala.Outside it had grown dark. From the deep trench of shadow betweenthe houses, lit up vaguely by the glimmer of street lamps,ascended the evening silence of Sulaco; the silence of a townwith few carriages, of unshod horses, and a softly sandalledpopulation. The windows of the Casa Gould flung their shiningparallelograms upon the house of the Avellanos. Now and then ashuffle of feet passed below with the pulsating red glow of acigarette at the foot of the walls; and the night air, as ifcooled by the snows of Higuerota, refreshed their faces."We Occidentals," said Martin Decoud, using the usual term theprovincials of Sulaco applied to themselves, "have been alwaysdistinct and separated. As long as we hold Cayta nothing canreach us. In all our troubles no army has marched over thosemountains.  A revolution in the central provinces isolates us atonce.  Look how complete it is now! The news of Barrios' movementwill be cabled to the United States, and only in that way will itreach Sta. Marta by the cable from the other seaboard. We havethe greatest riches, the greatest fertility, the purest blood inour great families, the most laborious population. The OccidentalProvince should stand alone. The early Federalism was not bad forus. Then came this union which Don Henrique Gould resisted. Itopened the road to tyranny; and, ever since, the rest ofCostaguana hangs like a millstone round our necks. The Occidentalterritory is large enough to make any man's country.  Look at themountains! Nature itself seems to cry to us, 'Separate!'"She made an energetic gesture of negation. A silence fell."Oh, yes, I know it's contrary to the doctrine laid down in the'History of Fifty Years' Misrule.' I am only trying to besensible. But my sense seems always to give you cause foroffence. Have I startled you very much with this perfectlyreasonable aspiration?"She shook her head. No, she was not startled, but the ideashocked her early convictions. Her patriotism was larger. She hadnever considered that possibility."It may yet be the means of saving some of your convictions," hesaid, prophetically.She did not answer. She seemed tired. They leaned side by side onthe rail of the little balcony, very friendly, having exhaustedpolitics, giving themselves up to the silent feeling of theirnearness, in one of those profound pauses that fall upon therhythm of passion.  Towards the plaza end of the street theglowing coals in the brazeros of the market women cooking theirevening meal gleamed red along the edge of the pavement.  A manappeared without a sound in the light of a street lamp, showingthe coloured inverted triangle of his bordered poncho, square onhis shoulders, hanging to a point below his knees. From theharbour end of the Calle a horseman walked his soft-steppingmount, gleaming silver-grey abreast each lamp under the darkshape of the rider."Behold the illustrious Capataz de Cargadores," said Decoud,gently, "coming in all his splendour after his work is done. Thenext great man of Sulaco after Don Carlos Gould. But he isgood-natured, and let me make friends with him.""Ah, indeed!" said Antonia. "How did you make friends?""A journalist ought to have his finger on the popular pulse, andthis man is one of the leaders of the populace.  A journalistought to know remarkable men--and this man is remarkable in hisway.""Ah, yes!" said Antonia, thoughtfully. "It is known that thisItalian has a great influence."The horseman had passed below them, with a gleam of dim light onthe shining broad quarters of the grey mare, on a bright heavystirrup, on a long silver spur; but the short flick of yellowishflame in the dusk was powerless against the muffled-upmysteriousness of the dark figure with an invisible faceconcealed by a great sombrero.Decoud and Antonia remained leaning over the balcony, side byside, touching elbows, with their heads overhanging the darknessof the street, and the brilliantly lighted sala at their backs.This was a tete-a-tete of extreme impropriety; something of whichin the whole extent of the Republic only the extraordinaryAntonia could be capable--the poor, motherless girl, neveraccompanied, with a careless father, who had thought only ofmaking her learned. Even Decoud himself seemed to feel that thiswas as much as he could expect of having her to himselftill--till the revolution was over and he could carry her off toEurope, away from the endlessness of civil strife, whose follyseemed even harder to bear than its ignominy. After one Monterothere would be another, the lawlessness of a populace of allcolours and races, barbarism, irremediable tyranny. As the greatLiberator Bolivar had said in the bitterness of his spirit,"America is ungovernable.  Those who worked for her independencehave ploughed the sea." He did not care, he declared boldly; heseized every opportunity to tell her that though she had managedto make a Blanco journalist of him, he was no patriot. First ofall, the word had no sense for cultured minds, to whom thenarrowness of every belief is odious; and secondly, in connectionwith the everlasting troubles of this unhappy country it washopelessly besmirched; it had been the cry of dark barbarism, thecloak of lawlessness, of crimes, of rapacity, of simple thieving.He was surprised at the warmth of his own utterance.  He had noneed to drop his voice; it had been low all the time, a meremurmur in the silence of dark houses with their shutters closedearly against the night air, as is the custom of Sulaco. Only thesala of the Casa Gould flung out defiantly the blaze of its fourwindows, the bright appeal of light in the whole dumb obscurityof the street. And the murmur on the little balcony went on aftera short pause."But we are labouring to change all that," Antonia protested. "Itis exactly what we desire. It is our object. It is the greatcause. And the word you despise has stood also for sacrifice, forcourage, for constancy, for suffering. Papa, who--""Ploughing the sea," interrupted Decoud, looking down.There was below the sound of hasty and ponderous footsteps."Your uncle, the grand-vicar of the cathedral, has just turnedunder the gate," observed Decoud. "He said Mass for the troops inthe Plaza this morning.  They had built for him an altar ofdrums, you know.  And they brought outside all the painted blocksto take the air. All the wooden saints stood militarily in a rowat the top of the great flight of steps. They looked like agorgeous escort attending the Vicar-General. I saw the greatfunction from the windows of the Porvenir. He is amazing, youruncle, the last of the Corbelans. He glittered exceedingly in hisvestments with a great crimson velvet cross down his back. Andall the time our saviour Barrios sat in the Amarilla Clubdrinking punch at an open window. Esprit fort--our Barrios. Iexpected every moment your uncle to launch an excommunicationthere and then at the black eye-patch in the window across thePlaza. But not at all. Ultimately the troops marched off. LaterBarrios came down with some of the officers, and stood with hisuniform all unbuttoned, discoursing at the edge of the pavement.Suddenly your uncle appeared, no longer glittering, but allblack, at the cathedral door with that threatening aspect hehas--you know, like a sort of avenging spirit. He gives one look,strides over straight at the group of uniforms, and leads awaythe general by the elbow. He walked him for a quarter of an hourin the shade of a wall. Never let go his elbow for a moment,talking all the time with exaltation, and gesticulating with along black arm. It was a curious scene. The officers seemedstruck with astonishment.  Remarkable man, your missionary uncle.He hates an infidel much less than a heretic, and prefers aheathen many times to an infidel. He condescends graciously tocall me a heathen, sometimes, you know."Antonia listened with her hands over the balustrade, opening andshutting the fan gently; and Decoud talked a little nervously, asif afraid that she would leave him at the first pause. Theircomparative isolation, the precious sense of intimacy, the slightcontact of their arms, affected him softly; for now and then atender inflection crept into the flow of his ironic murmurs."Any slight sign of favour from a relative of yours is welcome,Antonia. And perhaps he understands me, after all! But I knowhim, too, our Padre Corbelan.  The idea of political honour,justice, and honesty for him consists in the restitution of theconfiscated Church property. Nothing else could have drawn thatfierce converter of savage Indians out of the wilds to work forthe Ribierist cause! Nothing else but that wild hope!  He wouldmake a pronunciamiento himself for such an object against anyGovernment if he could only get followers! What does Don CarlosGould think of that? But, of course, with his Englishimpenetrability, nobody can tell what he thinks. Probably hethinks of nothing apart from his mine; of his 'Imperium inImperio.' As to Mrs. Gould, she thinks of her schools, of herhospitals, of the mothers with the young babies, of every sickold man in the three villages. If you were to turn your head nowyou would see her extracting a report from that sinister doctorin a check shirt--what's his name? Monygham--or else catechisingDon Pepe or perhaps listening to Padre Roman. They are all downhere to-day--all her ministers of state. Well, she is a sensiblewoman, and perhaps Don Carlos is a sensible man. It's a part ofsolid English sense not to think too much; to see only what maybe of practical use at the moment. These people are not likeourselves.  We have no political reason; we have politicalpassions--sometimes. What is a conviction? A particular view ofour personal advantage either practical or emotional.  No one isa patriot for nothing. The word serves us well. But I amclear-sighted, and I shall not use that word to you, Antonia! Ihave no patriotic illusions. I have only the supreme illusion ofa lover."He paused, then muttered almost inaudibly, "That can lead onevery far, though."Behind their backs the political tide that once in everytwenty-four hours set with a strong flood through the Goulddrawing-room could be heard, rising higher in a hum of voices.Men had been dropping in singly, or in twos and threes: thehigher officials of the province, engineers of the railway,sunburnt and in tweeds, with the frosted head of their chiefsmiling with slow, humorous indulgence amongst the young eagerfaces. Scarfe, the lover of fandangos, had already slipped out insearch of some dance, no matter where, on the outskirts of thetown. Don Juste Lopez, after taking his daughters home, hadentered solemnly, in a black creased coat buttoned up under hisspreading brown beard. The few members of the Provincial Assemblypresent clustered at once around their President to discuss thenews of the war and the last proclamation of the rebel Montero,the miserable Montero, calling in the name of "a justly incenseddemocracy" upon all the Provincial Assemblies of the Republic tosuspend their sittings till his sword had made peace and the willof the people could be consulted. It was practically aninvitation to dissolve: an unheard-of audacity of that evilmadman.The indignation ran high in the knot of deputies behind JoseAvellanos. Don Jose, lifting up his voice, cried out to them overthe high back of his chair, "Sulaco has answered by sendingto-day an army upon his flank. If all the other provinces showonly half as much patriotism as we Occidentals--"A great outburst of acclamations covered the vibrating treble ofthe life and soul of the party. Yes! Yes!  This was true! A greattruth! Sulaco was in the forefront, as ever! It was a boastfultumult, the hopefulness inspired by the event of the day breakingout amongst those caballeros of the Campo thinking of theirherds, of their lands, of the safety of their families.Everything was at stake. . . . No! It was impossible that Monteroshould succeed! This criminal, this shameless Indio! The clamourcontinued for some time, everybody else in the room lookingtowards the group where Don Juste had put on his air of impartialsolemnity as if presiding at a sitting of the ProvincialAssembly. Decoud had turned round at the noise, and, leaning hisback on the balustrade, shouted into the room with all thestrength of his lungs, "Gran' bestia!"This unexpected cry had the effect of stilling the noise. All theeyes were directed to the window with an approving expectation;but Decoud had already turned his back upon the room, and wasagain leaning out over the quiet street."This is the quintessence of my journalism; that is the supremeargument," he said to Antonia. "I have invented this definition,this last word on a great question. But I am no patriot. I am nomore of a patriot than the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores, thisGenoese who has done such great things for this harbour--thisactive usher-in of the material implements for our progress. Youhave heard Captain Mitchell confess over and over again that tillhe got this man he could never tell how long it would take tounload a ship.  That is bad for progress. You have seen him passby after his labours on his famous horse to dazzle the girls insome ballroom with an earthen floor. He is a fortunate fellow!His work is an exercise of personal powers; his leisure is spentin receiving the marks of extraordinary adulation. And he likesit, too. Can anybody be more fortunate? To be feared and admiredis--""And are these your highest aspirations, Don Martin?" interruptedAntonia."I was speaking of a man of that sort," said Decoud, curtly. "Theheroes of the world have been feared and admired. What more couldhe want?"Decoud had often felt his familiar habit of ironic thought fallshattered against Antonia's gravity. She irritated him as if she,too, had suffered from that inexplicable feminine obtusenesswhich stands so often between a man and a woman of the moreordinary sort.  But he overcame his vexation at once. He was veryfar from thinking Antonia ordinary, whatever verdict hisscepticism might have pronounced upon himself.  With a touch ofpenetrating tenderness in his voice he assured her that his onlyaspiration was to a felicity so high that it seemed almostunrealizable on this earth.She coloured invisibly, with a warmth against which the breezefrom the sierra seemed to have lost its cooling power in thesudden melting of the snows. His whisper could not have carriedso far, though there was enough ardour in his tone to melt aheart of ice. Antonia turned away abruptly, as if to carry hiswhispered assurance into the room behind, full of light, noisywith voices.The tide of political speculation was beating high within thefour walls of the great sala, as if driven beyond the marks by agreat gust of hope. Don Juste's fan-shaped beard was still thecentre of loud and animated discussions. There was aself-confident ring in all the voices. Even the few Europeansaround Charles Gould--a Dane, a couple of Frenchmen, a discreetfat German, smiling, with down-cast eyes, the representatives ofthose material interests that had got a footing in Sulaco underthe protecting might of the San Tome mine--had infused a lot ofgood humour into their deference. Charles Gould, to whom theywere paying their court, was the visible sign of the stabilitythat could be achieved on the shifting ground of revolutions.They felt hopeful about their various undertakings.  One of thetwo Frenchmen, small, black, with glittering eyes lost in animmense growth of bushy beard, waved his tiny brown hands anddelicate wrists.  He had been travelling in the interior of theprovince for a syndicate of European capitalists. His forcible"Monsieur l' Administrateur" returning every minute shrilledabove the steady hum of conversations. He was relating hisdiscoveries. He was ecstatic. Charles Gould glanced down at himcourteously.At a given moment of these necessary receptions it was Mrs.Gould's habit to withdraw quietly into a little drawing-room,especially her own, next to the great sala. She had risen, and,waiting for Antonia, listened with a slightly worriedgraciousness to the engineer-in-chief of the railway, who stoopedover her, relating slowly, without the slightest gesture,something apparently amusing, for his eyes had a humoroustwinkle. Antonia, before she advanced into the room to join Mrs.Gould, turned her head over her shoulder towards Decoud, only fora moment."Why should any one of us think his aspirations unrealizable?"she said, rapidly."I am going to cling to mine to the end, Antonia," he answered,through clenched teeth, then bowed very low, a little distantly.The engineer-in-chief had not finished telling his amusing story.The humours of railway building in South America appealed to hiskeen appreciation of the absurd, and he told his instances ofignorant prejudice and as ignorant cunning very well. Now, Mrs.Gould gave him all her attention as he walked by her sideescorting the ladies out of the room. Finally all three passedunnoticed through the glass doors in the gallery.  Only a tallpriest stalking silently in the noise of the sala checked himselfto look after them. Father Corbelan, whom Decoud had seen fromthe balcony turning into the gateway of the Casa Gould, hadaddressed no one since coming in. The long, skimpy soutaneaccentuated the tallness of his stature; he carried his powerfultorso thrown forward; and the straight, black bar of his joinedeyebrows, the pugnacious outline of the bony face, the white spotof a scar on the bluish shaven cheeks (a testimonial to hisapostolic zeal from a party of unconverted Indians), suggestedsomething unlawful behind his priesthood, the idea of a chaplainof bandits.He separated his bony, knotted hands clasped behind his back, toshake his finger at Martin.Decoud had stepped into the room after Antonia.  But he did notgo far. He had remained just within, against the curtain, with anexpression of not quite genuine gravity, like a grown-up persontaking part in a game of children. He gazed quietly at thethreatening finger."I have watched your reverence converting General Barrios by aspecial sermon on the Plaza," he said, without making theslightest movement."What miserable nonsense!" Father Corbelan's deep voice resoundedall over the room, making all the heads turn on the shoulders."The man is a drunkard.  Senores, the God of your General is abottle!"His contemptuous, arbitrary voice caused an uneasy suspension ofevery sound, as if the self-confidence of the gathering had beenstaggered by a blow. But nobody took up Father Corbelan'sdeclaration.It was known that Father Corbelan had come out of the wilds toadvocate the sacred rights of the Church with the same fanaticalfearlessness with which he had gone preaching to bloodthirstysavages, devoid of human compassion or worship of any kind.Rumours of legendary proportions told of his successes as amissionary beyond the eye of Christian men. He had baptized wholenations of Indians, living with them like a savage himself. Itwas related that the padre used to ride with his Indians fordays, half naked, carrying a bullock-hide shield, and, no doubt,a long lance, too--who knows?  That he had wandered clothed inskins, seeking for proselytes somewhere near the snow line of theCordillera.  Of these exploits Padre Corbelan himself was neverknown to talk. But he made no secret of his opinion that thepoliticians of Sta. Marta had harder hearts and more corruptminds than the heathen to whom he had carried the word of God.His injudicious zeal for the temporal welfare of the Church wasdamaging the Ribierist cause. It was common knowledge that he hadrefused to be made titular bishop of the Occidental diocese tilljustice was done to a despoiled Church. The political Gefe ofSulaco (the same dignitary whom Captain Mitchell saved from themob afterwards) hinted with naive cynicism that doubtless theirExcellencies the Ministers sent the padre over the mountains toSulaco in the worst season of the year in the hope that he wouldbe frozen to death by the icy blasts of the high paramos. Everyyear a few hardy muleteers--men inured to exposure--were known toperish in that way. But what would you have?  Their Excellenciespossibly had not realized what a tough priest he was. Meantime,the ignorant were beginning to murmur that the Ribierist reformsmeant simply the taking away of the land from the people.  Someof it was to be given to foreigners who made the railway; thegreater part was to go to the padres.These were the results of the Grand Vicar's zeal.  Even from theshort allocution to the troops on the Plaza (which only the firstranks could have heard) he had not been able to keep out hisfixed idea of an outraged Church waiting for reparation from apenitent country. The political Gefe had been exasperated.  Buthe could not very well throw the brother-in-law of Don Jose intothe prison of the Cabildo. The chief magistrate, an easy-goingand popular official, visited the Casa Gould, walking over aftersunset from the Intendencia, unattended, acknowledging withdignified courtesy the salutations of high and low alike. Thatevening he had walked up straight to Charles Gould and had hissedout to him that he would have liked to deport the Grand Vicar outof Sulaco, anywhere, to some desert island, to the Isabels, forinstance. "The one without water preferably--eh, Don Carlos?" hehad added in a tone between jest and earnest. This uncontrollablepriest, who had rejected his offer of the episcopal palace for aresidence and preferred to hang his shabby hammock amongst therubble and spiders of the sequestrated Dominican Convent, hadtaken into his head to advocate an unconditional pardon forHernandez the Robber! And this was not enough; he seemed to haveentered into communication with the most audacious criminal thecountry had known for years. The Sulaco police knew, of course,what was going on. Padre Corbelan had got hold of that recklessItalian, the Capataz de Cargadores, the only man fit for such anerrand, and had sent a message through him.  Father Corbelan hadstudied in Rome, and could speak Italian. The Capataz was knownto visit the old Dominican Convent at night. An old woman whoserved the Grand Vicar had heard the name of Hernandezpronounced; and only last Saturday afternoon the Capataz had beenobserved galloping out of town.  He did not return for two days.The police would have laid the Italian by the heels if it had notbeen for fear of the Cargadores, a turbulent body of men, quiteapt to raise a tumult. Nowadays it was not so easy to governSulaco. Bad characters flocked into it, attracted by the money inthe pockets of the railway workmen. The populace was maderestless by Father Corbelan's discourses.  And the firstmagistrate explained to Charles Gould that now the province wasstripped of troops any outbreak of lawlessness would find theauthorities with their boots off, as it were.Then he went away moodily to sit in an armchair, smoking a long,thin cigar, not very far from Don Jose, with whom, bending oversideways, he exchanged a few words from time to time. He ignoredthe entrance of the priest, and whenever Father Corbelan's voicewas raised behind him, he shrugged his shoulders impatiently.Father Corbelan had remained quite motionless for a time withthat something vengeful in his immobility which seemed tocharacterize all his attitudes. A lurid glow of strongconvictions gave its peculiar aspect to the black figure. But itsfierceness became softened as the padre, fixing his eyes uponDecoud, raised his long, black arm slowly, impressively--"And you--you are a perfect heathen," he said, in a subdued, deepvoice.He made a step nearer, pointing a forefinger at the young man'sbreast. Decoud, very calm, felt the wall behind the curtain withthe back of his head. Then, with his chin tilted well up, hesmiled."Very well," he agreed with the slightly weary nonchalance of aman well used to these passages. "But is it perhaps that you havenot discovered yet what is the God of my worship? It was aneasier task with our Barrios."The priest suppressed a gesture of discouragement.  "You believeneither in stick nor stone," he said."Nor bottle," added Decoud without stirring.  "Neither does theother of your reverence's confidants.  I mean the Capataz of theCargadores. He does not drink. Your reading of my character doeshonour to your perspicacity. But why call me a heathen?""True," retorted the priest. "You are ten times worse. A miraclecould not convert you.""I certainly do not believe in miracles," said Decoud, quietly.Father Corbelan shrugged his high, broad shoulders doubtfully."A sort of Frenchman--godless--a materialist," he pronouncedslowly, as if weighing the terms of a careful analysis. "Neitherthe son of his own country nor of any other," he continued,thoughtfully."Scarcely human, in fact," Decoud commented under his breath, hishead at rest against the wall, his eyes gazing up at the ceiling."The victim of this faithless age," Father Corbelan resumed in adeep but subdued voice."But of some use as a journalist." Decoud changed his pose andspoke in a more animated tone. "Has your worship neglected toread the last number of the Porvenir? I assure you it is justlike the others. On the general policy it continues to callMontero a gran' bestia, and stigmatize his brother, theguerrillero, for a combination of lackey and spy. What could bemore effective? In local affairs it urges the ProvincialGovernment to enlist bodily into the national army the band ofHernandez the Robber--who is apparently the protege of theChurch--or at least of the Grand Vicar. Nothing could be moresound."The priest nodded and turned on the heels of his square-toedshoes with big steel buckles. Again, with his hands claspedbehind his back, he paced to and fro, planting his feet firmly.When he swung about, the skirt of his soutane was inflatedslightly by the brusqueness of his movements.The great sala had been emptying itself slowly.  When the GefePolitico rose to go, most of those still remaining stood upsuddenly in sign of respect, and Don Jose Avellanos stopped therocking of his chair. But the good-natured First Official made adeprecatory gesture, waved his hand to Charles Gould, and wentout discreetly.In the comparative peace of the room the screaming "Monsieurl'Administrateur" of the frail, hairy Frenchman seemed to acquirea preternatural shrillness. The explorer of the Capitalistsyndicate was still enthusiastic.  "Ten million dollars' worth ofcopper practically in sight, Monsieur l'Administrateur. Tenmillions in sight!  And a railway coming--a railway! They willnever believe my report. C'est trop beau." He fell a prey to ascreaming ecstasy, in the midst of sagely nodding heads, beforeCharles Gould's imperturbable calm.And only the priest continued his pacing, flinging round theskirt of his soutane at each end of his beat.  Decoud murmured tohim ironically: "Those gentlemen talk about their gods."Father Corbelan stopped short, looked at the journalist of Sulacofixedly for a moment, shrugged his shoulders slightly, andresumed his plodding walk of an obstinate traveller.And now the Europeans were dropping off from the group aroundCharles Gould till the Administrador of the Great Silver Minecould be seen in his whole lank length, from head to foot, leftstranded by the ebbing tide of his guests on the great square ofcarpet, as it were a multi-coloured shoal of flowers andarabesques under his brown boots. Father Corbelan approached therocking-chair of Don Jose Avellanos."Come, brother," he said, with kindly brusqueness and a touch ofrelieved impatience a man may feel at the end of a perfectlyuseless ceremony. "A la Casa! A la Casa! This has been all talk.Let us now go and think and pray for guidance from Heaven."He rolled his black eyes upwards. By the side of the fraildiplomatist--the life and soul of the party--he seemed gigantic,with a gleam of fanaticism in the glance. But the voice of theparty, or, rather, its mouthpiece, the "son Decoud" from Paris,turned journalist for the sake of Antonia's eyes, knew very wellthat it was not so, that he was only a strenuous priest with oneidea, feared by the women and execrated by the men of the people.Martin Decoud, the dilettante in life, imagined himself to derivean artistic pleasure from watching the picturesque extreme ofwrongheadedness into which an honest, almost sacred, convictionmay drive a man. "It is like madness. It must be--because it'sself-destructive," Decoud had said to himself often. It seemed tohim that every conviction, as soon as it became effective, turnedinto that form of dementia the gods send upon those they wish todestroy. But he enjoyed the bitter flavour of that example withthe zest of a connoisseur in the art of his choice. Those two mengot on well together, as if each had felt respectively that amasterful conviction, as well as utter scepticism, may lead a manvery far on the by-paths of political action.Don Jose obeyed the touch of the big hairy hand.  Decoud followedout the brothers-in-law. And there remained only one visitor inthe vast empty sala, bluishly hazy with tobacco smoke, aheavy-eyed, round-cheeked man, with a drooping moustache, a hidemerchant from Esmeralda, who had come overland to Sulaco, ridingwith a few peons across the coast range.  He was very full of hisjourney, undertaken mostly for the purpose of seeing the SenorAdministrador of San Tome in relation to some assistance herequired in his hide-exporting business. He hoped to enlarge itgreatly now that the country was going to be settled. It wasgoing to be settled, he repeated several times, degrading by astrange, anxious whine the sonority of the Spanish language,which he pattered rapidly, like some sort of cringing jargon. Aplain man could carry on his little business now in the country,and even think of enlarging it--with safety. Was it not so? Heseemed to beg Charles Gould for a confirmatory word, a grunt ofassent, a simple nod even.He could get nothing. His alarm increased, and in the pauses hewould dart his eyes here and there; then, loth to give up, hewould branch off into feeling allusion to the dangers of hisjourney. The audacious Hernandez, leaving his usual haunts, hadcrossed the Campo of Sulaco, and was known to be lurking in theravines of the coast range. Yesterday, when distant only a fewhours from Sulaco, the hide merchant and his servants had seenthree men on the road arrested suspiciously, with their horses'heads together. Two of these rode off at once and disappeared ina shallow quebrada to the left. "We stopped," continued the manfrom Esmeralda, "and I tried to hide behind a small bush. Butnone of my mozos would go forward to find out what it meant, andthe third horseman seemed to be waiting for us to come up. It wasno use.  We had been seen. So we rode slowly on, trembling.  Helet us pass--a man on a grey horse with his hat down on hiseyes--without a word of greeting; but by-and-by we heard himgalloping after us. We faced about, but that did not seem tointimidate him. He rode up at speed, and touching my foot withthe toe of his boot, asked me for a cigar, with a blood-curdlinglaugh. He did not seem armed, but when he put his hand back toreach for the matches I saw an enormous revolver strapped to hiswaist. I shuddered. He had very fierce whiskers, Don Carlos, andas he did not offer to go on we dared not move. At last, blowingthe smoke of my cigar into the air through his nostrils, he said,'Senor, it would be perhaps better for you if I rode behind yourparty. You are not very far from Sulaco now. Go you with God.'What would you? We went on. There was no resisting him. He mighthave been Hernandez himself; though my servant, who has been manytimes to Sulaco by sea, assured me that he had recognized himvery well for the Capataz of the Steamship Company's Cargadores.Later, that same evening, I saw that very man at the corner ofthe Plaza talking to a girl, a Morenita, who stood by the stirrupwith her hand on the grey horse's mane.""I assure you, Senor Hirsch," murmured Charles Gould, "that youran no risk on this occasion.""That may be, senor, though I tremble yet. A most fierce man--tolook at. And what does it mean? A person employed by theSteamship Company talking with salteadores--no less, senor; theother horsemen were salteadores--in a lonely place, and behavinglike a robber himself! A cigar is nothing, but what was there toprevent him asking me for my purse?""No, no, Senor Hirsch," Charles Gould murmured, letting hisglance stray away a little vacantly from the round face, with itshooked beak upturned towards him in an almost childlike appeal."If it was the Capataz de Cargadores you met--and there is nodoubt, is there? --you were perfectly safe.""Thank you. You are very good. A very fierce-looking man, DonCarlos. He asked me for a cigar in a most familiar manner. Whatwould have happened if I had not had a cigar? I shudder yet. Whatbusiness had he to be talking with robbers in a lonely place?"But Charles Gould, openly preoccupied now, gave not a sign, madeno sound. The impenetrability of the embodied Gould Concessionhad its surface shades. To be dumb is merely a fatal affliction;but the King of Sulaco had words enough to give him all themysterious weight of a taciturn force. His silences, backed bythe power of speech, had as many shades of significance asuttered words in the way of assent, of doubt, of negation--evenof simple comment. Some seemed to say plainly, "Think it over";others meant clearly, "Go ahead"; a simple, low "I see," with anaffirmative nod, at the end of a patient listening half-hour wasthe equivalent of a verbal contract, which men had learned totrust implicitly, since behind it all there was the great SanTome mine, the head and front of the material interests, sostrong that it depended on no man's goodwill in the whole lengthand breadth of the Occidental Province--that is, on no goodwillwhich it could not buy ten times over. But to the littlehook-nosed man from Esmeralda, anxious about the export of hides,the silence of Charles Gould portended a failure. Evidently thiswas no time for extending a modest man's business. He envelopedin a swift mental malediction the whole country, with all itsinhabitants, partisans of Ribiera and Montero alike; and therewere incipient tears in his mute anger at the thought of theinnumerable ox-hides going to waste upon the dreamy expanse ofthe Campo, with its single palms rising like ships at sea withinthe perfect circle of the horizon, its clumps of heavy timbermotionless like solid islands of leaves above the running wavesof grass. There were hides there, rotting, with no profit toanybody--rotting where they had been dropped by men called awayto attend the urgent necessities of political revolutions.  Thepractical, mercantile soul of Senor Hirsch rebelled against allthat foolishness, while he was taking a respectful butdisconcerted leave of the might and majesty of the San Tome minein the person of Charles Gould. He could not restrain aheart-broken murmur, wrung out of his very aching heart, as itwere."It is a great, great foolishness, Don Carlos, all this.  Theprice of hides in Hamburg is gone up--up. Of course the RibieristGovernment will do away with all that--when it gets establishedfirmly. Meantime--"He sighed."Yes, meantime," repeated Charles Gould, inscrutably.The other shrugged his shoulders. But he was not ready to go yet.There was a little matter he would like to mention very much ifpermitted. It appeared he had some good friends in Hamburg (hemurmured the name of the firm) who were very anxious to dobusiness, in dynamite, he explained. A contract for dynamite withthe San Tome mine, and then, perhaps, later on, other mines,which were sure to--The little man from Esmeralda was ready toenlarge, but Charles interrupted him. It seemed as though thepatience of the Senor Administrador was giving way at last."Senor Hirsch," he said, "I have enough dynamite stored up at themountain to send it down crashing into the valley"--his voicerose a little--"to send half Sulaco into the air if I liked."Charles Gould smiled at the round, startled eyes of the dealer inhides, who was murmuring hastily, "Just so. Just so." And now hewas going. It was impossible to do business in explosives with anAdministrador so well provided and so discouraging. He hadsuffered agonies in the saddle and had exposed himself to theatrocities of the bandit Hernandez for nothing at all. Neitherhides nor dynamite--and the very shoulders of the enterprisingIsraelite expressed dejection.  At the door he bowed low to theengineer-in-chief. But at the bottom of the stairs in the patiohe stopped short, with his podgy hand over his lips in anattitude of meditative astonishment."What does he want to keep so much dynamite for?" he muttered."And why does he talk like this to me?"The engineer-in-chief, looking in at the door of the empty sala,whence the political tide had ebbed out to the last insignificantdrop, nodded familiarly to the master of the house, standingmotionless like a tall beacon amongst the deserted shoals offurniture."Good-night, I am going. Got my bike downstairs.  The railwaywill know where to go for dynamite should we get short at anytime. We have done cutting and chopping for a while now. We shallbegin soon to blast our way through.""Don't come to me," said Charles Gould, with perfect serenity. "Ishan't have an ounce to spare for anybody. Not an ounce. Not formy own brother, if I had a brother, and he were theengineer-in-chief of the most promising railway in the world.""What's that?" asked the engineer-in-chief, with equanimity."Unkindness?""No," said Charles Gould, stolidly. "Policy.""Radical, I should think," the engineer-in-chief observed fromthe doorway."Is that the right name?" Charles Gould said, from the middle ofthe room."I mean, going to the roots, you know," the engineer explained,with an air of enjoyment."Why, yes," Charles pronounced, slowly. "The Gould Concession hasstruck such deep roots in this country, in this province, in thatgorge of the mountains, that nothing but dynamite shall beallowed to dislodge it from there. It's my choice. It's my lastcard to play."The engineer-in-chief whistled low. "A pretty game," he said,with a shade of discretion. "And have you told Holroyd of thatextraordinary trump card you hold in your hand?""Card only when it's played; when it falls at the end of thegame. Till then you may call it a--a--""Weapon," suggested the railway man."No. You may call it rather an argument," corrected CharlesGould, gently. "And that's how I've presented it to Mr. Holroyd.""And what did he say to it?" asked the engineer, with undisguisedinterest."He"--Charles Gould spoke after a slight pause--"he saidsomething about holding on like grim death and putting our trustin God.   I should imagine he must have been rather startled. Butthen"--pursued the Administrador of the San Tome mine--"but then,he is very far away, you know, and, as they say in this country,God is very high above."The engineer's appreciative laugh died away down the stairs,where the Madonna with the Child on her arm seemed to look afterhis shaking broad back from her shallow niche.CHAPTER SIXA PROFOUND stillness reigned in the Casa Gould.  The master ofthe house, walking along the corredor, opened the door of hisroom, and saw his wife sitting in a big armchair--his own smokingarmchair--thoughtful, contemplating her little shoes. And she didnot raise her eyes when he walked in."Tired?" asked Charles Gould."A little," said Mrs. Gould. Still without looking up, she addedwith feeling, "There is an awful sense of unreality about allthis."Charles Gould, before the long table strewn with papers, on whichlay a hunting crop and a pair of spurs, stood looking at hiswife: "The heat and dust must have been awful this afternoon bythe waterside," he murmured, sympathetically. "The glare on thewater must have been simply terrible.""One could close one's eyes to the glare," said Mrs.  Gould."But, my dear Charley, it is impossible for me to close my eyesto our position; to this awful . . ."She raised her eyes and looked at her husband's face, from whichall sign of sympathy or any other feeling had disappeared. "Whydon't you tell me something?" she almost wailed."I thought you had understood me perfectly from the first,"Charles Gould said, slowly. "I thought we had said all there wasto say a long time ago. There is nothing to say now. There werethings to be done.  We have done them; we have gone on doingthem.  There is no going back now. I don't suppose that, evenfrom the first, there was really any possible way back.  And,what's more, we can't even afford to stand still.""Ah, if one only knew how far you mean to go," said his wife.inwardly trembling, but in an almost playful tone."Any distance, any length, of course," was the answer, in amatter-of-fact tone, which caused Mrs.  Gould to make anothereffort to repress a shudder.She stood up, smiling graciously, and her little figure seemed tobe diminished still more by the heavy mass of her hair and thelong train of her gown."But always to success," she said, persuasively.Charles Gould, enveloping her in the steely blue glance of hisattentive eyes, answered without hesitation--"Oh, there is no alternative."He put an immense assurance into his tone. As to the words, thiswas all that his conscience would allow him to say.Mrs. Gould's smile remained a shade too long upon her lips. Shemurmured--"I will leave you; I've a slight headache. The heat, the dust,were indeed--I suppose you are going back to the mine before themorning?""At midnight," said Charles Gould. "We are bringing down thesilver to-morrow. Then I shall take three whole days off in townwith you.""Ah, you are going to meet the escort. I shall be on the balconyat five o'clock to see you pass. Till then, good-bye."Charles Gould walked rapidly round the table, and, seizing herhands, bent down, pressing them both to his lips. Before hestraightened himself up again to his full height she haddisengaged one to smooth his cheek with a light touch, as if hewere a little boy."Try to get some rest for a couple of hours," she murmured, witha glance at a hammock stretched in a distant part of the room.Her long train swished softly after her on the red tiles. At thedoor she looked back.Two big lamps with unpolished glass globes bathed in a soft andabundant light the four white walls of the room, with a glasscase of arms, the brass hilt of Henry Gould's cavalry sabre onits square of velvet, and the water-colour sketch of the San Tomegorge. And Mrs.  Gould, gazing at the last in its black woodenframe, sighed out--"Ah, if we had left it alone, Charley!""No," Charles Gould said, moodily; "it was impossible to leave italone.""Perhaps it was impossible," Mrs. Gould admitted, slowly. Herlips quivered a little, but she smiled with an air of daintybravado. "We have disturbed a good many snakes in that Paradise,Charley, haven't we?""Yes, I remember," said Charles Gould, "it was Don Pepe whocalled the gorge the Paradise of snakes.  No doubt we havedisturbed a great many. But remember, my dear, that it is not nowas it was when you made that sketch." He waved his hand towardsthe small water-colour hanging alone upon the great bare wall."It is no longer a Paradise of snakes. We have brought mankindinto it, and we cannot turn our backs upon them to go and begin anew life elsewhere."He confronted his wife with a firm, concentrated gaze, which Mrs.Gould returned with a brave assumption of fearlessness before shewent out, closing the door gently after her.In contrast with the white glaring room the dimly lit corredorhad a restful mysteriousness of a forest glade, suggested by thestems and the leaves of the plants ranged along the balustrade ofthe open side. In the streaks of light falling through the opendoors of the reception-rooms, the blossoms, white and red andpale lilac, came out vivid with the brilliance of flowers in astream of sunshine; and Mrs. Gould, passing on, had the vividnessof a figure seen in the clear patches of sun that chequer thegloom of open glades in the woods. The stones in the rings uponher hand pressed to her forehead glittered in the lamplightabreast of the door of the sala."Who's there?" she asked, in a startled voice. "Is that you,Basilio?" She looked in, and saw Martin Decoud walking about,with an air of having lost something, amongst the chairs andtables."Antonia has forgotten her fan in here," said Decoud, with astrange air of distraction; "so I entered to see."But, even as he said this, he had obviously given up his search,and walked straight towards Mrs. Gould, who looked at him withdoubtful surprise."Senora," he began, in a low voice."What is it, Don Martin?" asked Mrs. Gould. And then she added,with a slight laugh, "I am so nervous to-day," as if to explainthe eagerness of the question."Nothing immediately dangerous," said Decoud, who now could notconceal his agitation. "Pray Jack don't distress yourself Jack. No, really,you must not distress yourself."Mrs. Gould, with her candid eyes very wide open, her lipscomposed into a smile, was steadying herself with a littlebejewelled hand against the side of the door."Perhaps you don't know how alarming you are, appearing like thisunexpectedly--""I! Alarming!" he protested, sincerely vexed and surprised. "Iassure you that I am not in the least alarmed myself. A fan islost; well, it will be found again. But I don't think it is here.It is a fan I am looking for. I cannot understand how Antoniacould--Well! Have you found it, amigo?""No, senor," said behind Mrs. Gould the soft voice of Basilio,the head servant of the Casa. "I don't think the senorita couldhave left it in this house at all.""Go and look for it in the patio again. Go now, my friend; lookfor it on the steps, under the gate; examine every flagstone;search for it till I come down again. . . . That fellow"--headdressed himself in English to Mrs. Gould--"is always stealingup behind one's back on his bare feet. I set him to look for thatfan directly I came in to justify my reappearance, my suddenreturn."He paused and Mrs. Gould said, amiably, "You are always welcome."She paused for a second, too. "But I am waiting to learn thecause of your return."Decoud affected suddenly the utmost nonchalance."I can't bear to be spied upon. Oh, the cause?  Yes, there is acause; there is something else that is lost besides Antonia'sfavourite fan. As I was walking home after seeing Don Jose andAntonia to their house, the Capataz de Cargadores, riding downthe street, spoke to me.""Has anything happened to the Violas?" inquired Mrs. Gould."The Violas? You mean the old Garibaldino who keeps the hotelwhere the engineers live? Nothing happened there. The Capatazsaid nothing of them; he only told me that the telegraphist ofthe Cable Company was walking on the Plaza, bareheaded, lookingout for me. There is news from the interior, Mrs. Gould.  Ishould rather say rumours of news.""Good news?" said Mrs. Gould in a low voice."Worthless, I should think. But if I must define them, I wouldsay bad. They are to the effect that a two days' battle had beenfought near Sta. Marta, and that the Ribierists are defeated. Itmust have happened a few days ago--perhaps a week. The rumour hasjust reached Cayta, and the man in charge of the cable stationthere has telegraphed the news to his colleague here. We mightjust as well have kept Barrios in Sulaco.""What's to be done now?" murmured Mrs. Gould."Nothing. He's at sea with the troops. He will get to Cayta in acouple of days' time and learn the news there. What he will dothen, who can say?  Hold Cayta? Offer his submission to Montero?Disband his army--this last most likely, and go himself in one ofthe O.S.N. Company's steamers, north or south--to Valparaiso orto San Francisco, no matter where. Our Barrios has a greatpractice in exiles and repatriations, which mark the points inthe political game."Decoud, exchanging a steady stare with Mrs. Gould, added,tentatively, as it were, "And yet, if we had could have beendone.""Montero victorious, completely victorious!" Mrs.  Gould breathedout in a tone of unbelief."A canard, probably. That sort of bird is hatched in greatnumbers in such times as these. And even if it were true? Well,let us put things at their worst, let us say it is true.""Then everything is lost," said Mrs. Gould, with the calmness ofdespair.Suddenly she seemed to divine, she seemed to see Decoud'stremendous excitement under its cloak of studied carelessness. Itwas, indeed, becoming visible in his audacious and watchfulstare, in the curve, half-reckless, half-contemptuous, of hislips. And a French phrase came upon them as if, for thisCostaguanero of the Boulevard, that had been the only forciblelanguage--"Non, Madame. Rien n'est perdu."It electrified Mrs. Gould out of her benumbed attitude, and shesaid, vivaciously--"What would you think of doing?"But already there was something of mockery in Decoud's suppressedexcitement."What would you expect a true Costaguanero to do?  Anotherrevolution, of course. On my word of honour, Mrs. Gould, Ibelieve I am a true hijo del pays, a true son of the country,whatever Father Corbelan may say.  And I'm not so much of anunbeliever as not to have faith in my own ideas, in my ownremedies, in my own desires.""Yes," said Mrs. Gould, doubtfully."You don't seem convinced," Decoud went on again in French. "Say,then, in my passions."Mrs. Gould received this addition unflinchingly. To understand itthoroughly she did not require to hear his muttered assurance--"There is nothing I would not do for the sake of Antonia. Thereis nothing I am not prepared to undertake.  There is no risk I amnot ready to run."Decoud seemed to find a fresh audacity in this voicing of histhoughts. "You would not believe me if I were to say that it isthe love of the country which--"She made a sort of discouraged protest with her arm, as if toexpress that she had given up expecting that motive from any one."A Sulaco revolution," Decoud pursued in a forcible undertone."The Great Cause may be served here, on the very spot of itsinception, in the place of its birth, Mrs. Gould."Frowning, and biting her lower lip thoughtfully, she made a stepaway from the door."You are not going to speak to your husband?" Decoud arrested heranxiously."But you will need his help?""No doubt," Decoud admitted without hesitation.  "Everythingturns upon the San Tome mine, but I would rather he didn't knowanything as yet of my--my hopes."A puzzled look came upon Mrs. Gould's face, and Decoud,approaching, explained confidentially--"Don't you see, he's such an idealist."Mrs. Gould flushed pink, and her eyes grew darker at the sametime."Charley an idealist!" she said, as if to herself, wonderingly."What on earth do you mean?""Yes," conceded Decoud, "it's a wonderful thing to say with thesight of the San Tome mine, the greatest fact in the whole ofSouth America, perhaps, before our very eyes. But look even atthat, he has idealized this fact to a point--" He paused. "Mrs.Gould, are you aware to what point he has idealized theexistence, the worth, the meaning of the San Tome mine? Are youaware of it?"He must have known what he was talking about.The effect he expected was produced. Mrs. Gould, ready to takefire, gave it up suddenly with a low little sound that resembleda moan."What do you know?" she asked in a feeble voice."Nothing," answered Decoud, firmly. "But, then, don't you see,he's an Englishman?""Well, what of that?" asked Mrs. Gould."Simply that he cannot act or exist without idealizing everysimple feeling, desire, or achievement. He could not believe hisown motives if he did not make them first a part of some fairytale. The earth is not quite good enough for him, I fear. Do youexcuse my frankness? Besides, whether you excuse it or not, it ispart of the truth of things which hurts the--what do you callthem?--the Anglo-Saxon's susceptibilities, and at the presentmoment I don't feel as if I could treat seriously either hisconception of things or--if you allow me to say so--or yetyours."Mrs. Gould gave no sign of being offended. "I suppose Antoniaunderstands you thoroughly?""Understands? Well, yes. But I am not sure that she approves.That, however, makes no difference. I am honest enough to tellyou that, Mrs. Gould.""Your idea, of course, is separation," she said."Separation, of course," declared Martin. "Yes; separation of thewhole Occidental Province from the rest of the unquiet body. Butmy true idea, the only one I care for, is not to be separatedfrom Antonia.""And that is all?" asked Mrs. Gould, without severity."Absolutely. I am not deceiving myself about my motives. Shewon't leave Sulaco for my sake, therefore Sulaco must leave therest of the Republic to its fate. Nothing could be clearer thanthat. I like a clearly defined situation. I cannot part withAntonia, therefore the one and indivisible Republic of Costaguanamust be made to part with its western province. Fortunately ithappens to be also a sound policy. The richest, the most fertilepart of this land may be saved from anarchy. Personally, I carelittle, very little; but it's a fact that the establishment ofMontero in power would mean death to me. In all the proclamationsof general pardon which I have seen, my name, with a few others,is specially excepted. The brothers hate me, as you know verywell, Mrs. Gould; and behold, here is the rumour of them havingwon a battle. You say that supposing it is true, I have plenty oftime to run away."The slight, protesting murmur on the part of Mrs.  Gould made himpause for a moment, while he looked at her with a sombre andresolute glance."Ah, but I would, Mrs. Gould. I would run away if it served thatwhich at present is my only desire. I am courageous enough to saythat, and to do it, too.  But women, even our women, areidealists. It is Antonia that won't run away. A novel sort ofvanity.""You call it vanity," said Mrs. Gould, in a shocked voice."Say pride, then, which. Father Corbelan would tell you, is amortal sin. But I am not proud. I am simply too much in love torun away. At the same time I want to live. There is no love for adead man. Therefore it is necessary that Sulaco should notrecognize the victorious Montero.""And you think my husband will give you his support?""I think he can be drawn into it, like all idealists, when heonce sees a sentimental basis for his action.  But I wouldn'ttalk to him. Mere clear facts won't appeal to his sentiment. Itis much better for him to convince himself in his own way. And,frankly, I could not, perhaps, just now pay sufficient respect toeither his motives or even, perhaps, to yours, Mrs. Gould."It was evident that Mrs. Gould was very determined not to beoffended. She smiled vaguely, while she seemed to think thematter over. As far as she could judge from the girl'shalf-confidences, Antonia understood that young man. Obviouslythere was promise of safety in his plan, or rather in his idea.Moreover, right or wrong, the idea could do no harm. And it wasquite possible, also, that the rumour was false."You have some sort of a plan," she said."Simplicity itself. Barrios has started, let him go on then; hewill hold Cayta, which is the door of the sea route to Sulaco.They cannot send a sufficient force over the mountains. No; noteven to cope with the band of Hernandez. Meantime we shallorganize our resistance here. And for that, this very Hernandezwill be useful. He has defeated troops as a bandit; he will nodoubt accomplish the same thing if he is made a colonel or even ageneral. You know the country well enough not to be shocked bywhat I say, Mrs. Gould.  I have heard you assert that this poorbandit was the living,breathing example of cruelty, injustice,stupidity, and oppression, that ruin men's souls as well as theirfortunes in this country. Well, there would be some poeticalretribution in that man arising to crush the evils which haddriven an honest ranchero into a life of crime. A fine idea ofretribution in that, isn't there?"Decoud had dropped easily into English, which he spoke withprecision, very correctly, but with too many z sounds."Think also of your hospitals, of your schools, of your ailingmothers and feeble old men, of all that population which you andyour husband have brought into the rocky gorge of San Tome. Areyou not responsible to your conscience for all these people? Isit not worth while to make another effort, which is not at all sodesperate as it looks, rather than--"Decoud finished his thought with an upward toss of the arm,suggesting annihilation; and Mrs. Gould turned away her head witha look of horror."Why don't you say all this to my husband?" she asked, withoutlooking at Decoud, who stood watching the effect of his words."Ah! But Don Carlos is so English," he began.  Mrs. Gouldinterrupted--"Leave that alone, Don Martin. He's as much a Costaguanero--No!He's more of a Costaguanero than yourself.""Sentimentalist, sentimentalist," Decoud almost cooed, in a toneof gentle and soothing deference.  "Sentimentalist, after theamazing manner of your people. I have been watching El Rey deSulaco since I came here on a fool's errand, and perhaps impelledby some treason of fate lurking behind the unaccountable turns ofa man's life. But I don't matter, I am not a sentimentalist, Icannot endow my personal desires with a shining robe of silk andjewels. Life is not for me a moral romance derived from thetradition of a pretty fairy tale. No, Mrs. Gould; I am practical.I am not afraid of my motives. But, pardon me, I have been rathercarried away. What I wish to say is that I have been observing. Iwon't tell you what I have discovered--""No. That is unnecessary," whispered Mrs. Gould, once moreaverting her head."It is. Except one little fact, that your husband does not likeme. It's a small matter, which, in the circumstances, seems toacquire a perfectly ridiculous importance.  Ridiculous andimmense; for, clearly, money is required for my plan," hereflected; then added, meaningly, "and we have twosentimentalists to deal with.""I don't know that I understand you, Don Martin," said Mrs.Gould, coldly, preserving the low key of their conversation."But, speaking as if I did, who is the other?""The great Holroyd in San Francisco, of course," Decoudwhispered, lightly. "I think you understand me very well. Womenare idealists; but then they are so perspicacious."But whatever was the reason of that remark, disparaging andcomplimentary at the same time, Mrs.  Gould seemed not to payattention to it. The name of Holroyd had given a new tone to heranxiety."The silver escort is coming down to the harbour tomorrow; awhole six months' working, Don Martin!" she cried in dismay."Let it come down, then," breathed out Decoud, earnestly, almostinto her ear."But if the rumour should get about, and especially if it turnedout true, troubles might break out in the town," objected Mrs.Gould.Decoud admitted that it was possible.  He knew well the townchildren of the Sulaco Campo: sullen, thievish, vindictive, andbloodthirsty, whatever great qualities their brothers of theplain might have had.  But then there was that othersentimentalist, who attached a strangely idealistic meaning toconcrete facts. This stream of silver must be kept flowing northto return in the form of financial backing from the great houseof Holroyd. Up at the mountain in the strong room of the mine thesilver bars were worth less for his purpose than so much lead,from which at least bullets may be run. Let it come down to theharbour, ready for shipment.The next north-going steamer would carry it off for the verysalvation of the San Tome mine, which had produced so muchtreasure.  And, moreover, the rumour was probably false, heremarked, with much conviction in his hurried tone."Besides, senora," concluded Decoud, "we may suppress it for manydays. I have been talking with the telegraphist in the middle ofthe Plaza Mayor; thus I am certain that we could not have beenoverheard.  There was not even a bird in the air near us. Andalso let me tell you something more. I have been making friendswith this man called Nostromo, the Capataz.  We had aconversation this very evening, I walking by the side of hishorse as he rode slowly out of the town just now. He promised methat if a riot took place for any reason--even for the mostpolitical of reasons, you understand--his Cargadores, animportant part of the populace, you will admit, should be foundon the side of the Europeans.""He has promised you that?" Mrs. Gould inquired, with interest."What made him make that promise to you?""Upon my word, I don't know," declared Decoud, in a slightlysurprised tone. "He certainly promised me that, but now you askme why, I could not tell you his reasons. He talked with hisusual carelessness, which, if he had been anything else but acommon sailor, I would call a pose or an affectation."Decoud, interrupting himself, looked at Mrs. Gould curiously."Upon the whole," he continued, "I suppose he expects somethingto his advantage from it. You mustn't forget that he does notexercise his extraordinary power over the lower classes without acertain amount of personal risk and without a great profusion inspending his money. One must pay in some way or other for such asolid thing as individual prestige. He told me after we madefriends at a dance, in a Posada kept by a Mexican just outsidethe walls, that he had come here to make his fortune. I supposehe looks upon his prestige as a sort of investment.""Perhaps he prizes it for its own sake," Mrs. Gould said in atone as if she were repelling an undeserved aspersion. "Viola,the Garibaldino, with whom he has lived for some years, calls himthe Incorruptible.""Ah! he belongs to the group of your proteges out there towardsthe harbour, Mrs. Gould.   Muy bien.  And Captain Mitchell callshim wonderful. I have heard no end of tales of his strength, hisaudacity, his fidelity. No end of fine things. H'm!incorruptible!  It is indeed a name of honour for the Capataz ofthe Cargadores of Sulaco. Incorruptible! Fine, but vague.However, I suppose he's sensible, too. And I talked to him uponthat sane and practical assumption.""I prefer to think him disinterested, and therefore trustworthy,"Mrs. Gould said, with the nearest approach to curtness it was inher nature to assume."Well, if so, then the silver will be still more safe.  Let itcome down, senora. Let it come down, so that it may go north andreturn to us in the shape of credit."Mrs. Gould glanced along the corredor towards the door of herhusband's room. Decoud, watching her as if she had his fate inher hands, detected an almost imperceptible nod of assent. Hebowed with a smile, and, putting his hand into the breast pocketof his coat, pulled out a fan of light feathers set upon paintedleaves of sandal-wood. "I had it in my pocket," he murmured,triumphantly, "for a plausible pretext." He bowed again."Good-night, senora."Mrs. Gould continued along the corredor away from her husband'sroom. The fate of the San Tome mine was lying heavy upon herheart. It was a long time now since she had begun to fear it. Ithad been an idea. She had watched it with misgivings turning intoa fetish, and now the fetish had grown into a monstrous andcrushing weight. It was as if the inspiration of their earlyyears had left her heart to turn into a wall of silver-bricks,erected by the silent work of evil spirits, between her and herhusband. He seemed to dwell alone within a circumvallation ofprecious metal, leaving her outside with her school, herhospital, the sick mothers and the feeble old men, mereinsignificant vestiges of the initial inspiration.  "Those poorpeople!" she murmured to herself.Below she heard the voice of Martin Decoud in the patio speakingloudly:"I have found Dona Antonia's fan, Basilio. Look.  here it is!"CHAPTER SEVENIT WAS part of what Decoud would have called his sane materialismthat he did not believe in the possibility of friendship betweenman and woman.The one exception he allowed confirmed, he maintained, thatabsolute rule. Friendship was possible between brother andsister, meaning by friendship the frank unreserve, as beforeanother human being, of thoughts and sensations; all theobjectless and necessary sincerity of one's innermost life tryingto re-act upon the profound sympathies of another existence.His favourite sister, the handsome, slightly arbitrary andresolute angel, ruling the father and mother Decoud in thefirst-floor apartments of a very fine Parisian house, was therecipient of Martin Decoud's confidences as to his thoughts,actions, purposes, doubts, and even failures. . . ."Prepare our little circle in Paris for the birth of anotherSouth American Republic. One more or less, what does it matter?They may come into the world like evil flowers on a hotbed ofrotten institutions; but the seed of this one has germinated inyour brother's brain, and that will be enough for your devotedassent.  I am writing this to you by the light of a singlecandle, in a sort of inn, near the harbour, kept by an Italiancalled Viola, a protege of Mrs. Gould. The whole building, which,for all I know, may have been contrived by a Conquistador farmerof the pearl fishery three hundred years ago, is perfectlysilent. So is the plain between the town and the harbour; silent,but not so dark as the house, because the pickets of Italianworkmen guarding the railway have lighted little fires all alongthe line. It was not so quiet around here yesterday. We had anawful riot--a sudden outbreak of the populace, which was notsuppressed till late today.  Its object, no doubt, was loot, andthat was defeated, as you may have learned already from thecablegram sent via San Francisco and New York last night, whenthe cables were still open. You have read already there that theenergetic action of the Europeans of the railway has saved thetown from destruction, and you may believe that. I wrote out thecable myself.  We have no Reuter's agency man here. I have alsofired at the mob from the windows of the club, in company withsome other young men of position. Our object was to keep theCalle de la Constitucion clear for the exodus of the ladies andchildren, who have taken refuge on board a couple of cargo shipsnow in the harbour here. That was yesterday. You should also havelearned from the cable that the missing President, Ribiera, whohad disappeared after the battle of Sta.  Marta, has turned uphere in Sulaco by one of those strange coincidences that arealmost incredible, riding on a lame mule into the very midst ofthe street fighting.  It appears that he had fled, in company ofa muleteer called Bonifacio, across the mountains from thethreats of Montero into the arms of an enraged mob."The Capataz of Cargadores, that Italian sailor of whom I havewritten to you before, has saved him from an ignoble death. Thatman seems to have a particular talent for being on the spotwhenever there is something picturesque to be done."He was with me at four o'clock in the morning at the offices ofthe Porvenir, where he had turned up so early in order to warn meof the coming trouble, and also to assure me that he would keephis Cargadores on the side of order. When the full daylight camewe were looking together at the crowd on foot and on horseback,demonstrating on the Plaza and shying stones at the windows ofthe Intendencia. Nostromo (that is the name they call him byhere) was pointing out to me his Cargadores interspersed in themob."The sun shines late upon Sulaco, for it has first to climb abovethe mountains. In that clear morning light, brighter thantwilight, Nostromo saw right across the vast Plaza, at the end ofthe street beyond the cathedral, a mounted man apparently indifficulties with a yelling knot of leperos. At once he said tome, 'That's a stranger. What is it they are doing to him?' Thenhe took out the silver whistle he is in the habit of using on thewharf (this man seems to disdain the use of any metal lessprecious than silver) and blew into it twice, evidently apreconcerted signal for his Cargadores. He ran out immediately,and they rallied round him. I ran out, too, but was too late tofollow them and help in the rescue of the stranger, whose animalhad fallen.  I was set upon at once as a hated aristocrat, andwas only too glad to get into the club, where Don Jaime Berges(you may remember him visiting at our house in Paris some threeyears ago) thrust a sporting gun into my hands. They were alreadyfiring from the windows.  There were little heaps of cartridgeslying about on the open card-tables. I remember a couple ofoverturned chairs, some bottles rolling on the floor amongst thepacks of cards scattered suddenly as the caballeros rose fromtheir game to open fire upon the mob. Most of the young men hadspent the night at the club in the expectation of some suchdisturbance. In two of the candelabra, on the consoles, thecandles were burning down in their sockets. A large iron nut,probably stolen from the railway workshops, flew in from thestreet as I entered, and broke one of the large mirrors set inthe wall. I noticed also one of the club servants tied up handand foot with the cords of the curtain and flung in a corner. Ihave a vague recollection of Don Jaime assuring me hastily thatthe fellow had been detected putting poison into the dishes atsupper. But I remember distinctly he was shrieking for mercy,without stopping at all, continuously, and so absolutelydisregarded that nobody even took the trouble to gag him. Thenoise he made was so disagreeable that I had half a mind to do itmyself. But there was no time to waste on such trifles. I took mymoneyplace at one of the windows and began firing."I didn't learn till later in the afternoon whom it was thatNostromo, with his Cargadores and some Italian workmen as well,had managed to save from those drunken rascals. That man has apeculiar talent when anything striking to the imagination has tobe done. I made that remark to him afterwards when we met aftersome sort of order had been restored in the town, and the answerhe made rather surprised me. He said quite moodily, 'And how muchdo I get for that, senor?' Then it dawned upon me that perhapsthis man's vanity has been satiated by the adulation of thecommon people and the confidence of his superiors!"Decoud paused to light a cigarette, then, with his head stillover his writing, he blew a cloud of smoke, which seemed torebound from the paper. He took up the pencil again."That was yesterday evening on the Plaza, while he sat on thesteps of the cathedral, his hands between his knees, holding thebridle of his famous silver-grey mare.  He had led his body ofCargadores splendidly all day long. He looked fatigued. I don'tknow how I looked. Very dirty, I suppose. But I suppose I alsolooked pleased. From the time the fugitive President had been gotoff to the S. S. Minerva, the tide of success had turned againstthe mob. They had been driven off the harbour, and out of thebetter streets of the town, into their own maze of ruins andtolderias. You must understand that this riot, whose primaryobject was undoubtedly the getting hold of the San Tome silverstored in the lower rooms of the Custom House (besides thegeneral looting of the Ricos), had acquired a political colouringfrom the fact of two Deputies to the Provincial Assembly, SenoresGamacho and Fuentes, both from Bolson, putting themselves at thehead of it--late in the afternoon, it is true, when the mob,disappointed in their hopes of loot, made a stand in the narrowstreets to the cries of 'Viva la Libertad! Down with Feudalism!'(I wonder what they imagine feudalism to be?) 'Down with theGoths and Paralytics.' I suppose the Senores Gamacho and Fuentesknew what they were doing. They are prudent gentlemen.  In theAssembly they called themselves Moderates, and opposed everyenergetic measure with philanthropic pensiveness. At the firstrumours of Montero's victory, they showed a subtle change of thepensive temper, and began to defy poor Don Juste Lopez in hisPresidential tribune with an effrontery to which the poor mancould only respond by a dazed smoothing of his beard and theringing of the presidential bell. Then, when the downfall of theRibierist cause became confirmed beyond the shadow of a doubt,they have blossomed into convinced Liberals, acting together asif they were Siamese twins, and ultimately taking charge, as itwere, of the riot in the name of Monterist principles."Their last move of eight o'clock last night was to organizethemselves into a Monterist Committee which sits, as far as Iknow, in a posada kept by a retired Mexican bull-fighter, a greatpolitician, too, whose name I have forgotten. Thence they haveissued a communication to us, the Goths and Paralytics of theAmarilla Club (who have our own committee), inviting us to cometo some provisional understanding for a truce, in order, theyhave the impudence to say, that the noble cause of Liberty'should not be stained by the criminal excesses of Conservativeselfishness!' As I came out to sit with Nostromo on the cathedralsteps the club was busy considering a proper reply in theprincipal room, littered with exploded cartridges, with a lot ofbroken glass, blood smears, candlesticks, and all sorts ofwreckage on the floor. But all this is nonsense.  Nobody in thetown has any real power except the railway engineers, whose menoccupy the dismantled houses acquired by the Company for theirtown station on one side of the Plaza, and Nostromo, whoseCargadores were sleeping under the arcades along the front ofAnzani's shops. A fire of broken furniture out of the Intendenciasaloons, mostly gilt, was burning on the Plaza, in a high flameswaying right upon the statue of Charles IV. The dead body of aman was lying on the steps of the pedestal, his arms thrown wideopen, and his sombrero covering his face--the attention of somefriend, perhaps. The light of the flames touched the foliage ofthe first trees on the Alameda, and played on the end of a sidestreet near by, blocked up by a jumble of ox-carts and deadbullocks. Sitting on one of the carcasses, a lepero, muffled up,smoked a cigarette. It was a truce, you understand. The onlyother living being on the Plaza besides ourselves was a Cargadorwalking to and fro, with a long, bare knife in his hand, like asentry before the Arcades, where his friends were sleeping. Andthe only other spot of light in the dark town were the lightedwindows of the club, at the corner of the Calle."After having written so far, Don Martin Decoud, the exotic dandyof the Parisian boulevard, got up and walked across the sandedfloor of the cafe at one end of the Albergo of United Italy, keptby Giorgio Viola, the old companion of Garibaldi. The highlycoloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly, inthe light of one candle, at the man with no faith in anythingexcept the truth of his own sensations. Looking out of thewindow, Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that hecould see neither the mountains nor the town, nor yet thebuildings near the harbour; and there was not a sound, as if thetremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf, spreading from thewaters over the land, had made it dumb as well as blind.Presently Decoud felt a light tremor of the floor and a distantclank of iron. A bright white light appeared, deep in thedarkness, growing bigger with a thundering noise. The rollingstock usually kept on the sidings in Rincon was being run back tothe yards for safe keeping.  Like a mysterious stirring of thedarkness behind the headlight of the engine, the train passed ina gust of hollow uproar, by the end of the house, which seemed tovibrate all over in response. And nothing was clearly visiblebut, on the end of the last flat car, a negro, in white trousersand naked to the waist, swinging a blazing torch basketincessantly with a circular movement of his bare arm. Decoud didnot stir.Behind him, on the back of the chair from which he had risen,hung his elegant Parisian overcoat, with a pearl-grey silklining. But when he turned back to come to the table thecandlelight fell upon a face that was grimy and scratched. Hisrosy lips were blackened with heat, the smoke of gun-powder. Dirtand rust tarnished the lustre of his short beard. His shirtcollar and cuffs were crumpled; the blue silken tie hung down hisbreast like a rag; a greasy smudge crossed his white brow. He hadnot taken off his clothing nor used water, except to snatch ahasty drink greedily, for some forty hours. An awful restlessnesshad made him its own, had marked him with all the signs ofdesperate strife, and put a dry, sleepless stare into his eyes.He murmured to himself in a hoarse voice, "I wonder if there'sany bread here," looked vaguely about him, then dropped into thechair and took the pencil up again.  He became aware he had noteaten anything for many hours.It occurred to him that no one could understand him so well ashis sister. In the most sceptical heart there lurks at suchmoments, when the chances of existence are involved, a desire toleave a correct impression of the feelings, like a light by whichthe action may be seen when personality is gone, gone where nolight of investigation can ever reach the truth which every deathtakes out of the world. Therefore, instead of looking forsomething to eat, or trying to snatch an hour or so of sleep,Decoud was filling the pages of a large pocket-book with a letterto his sister.In the intimacy of that intercourse he could not keep out hisweariness, his great fatigue, the close touch of his bodilysensations. He began again as if he were talking to her. Withalmost an illusion of her presence, he wrote the phrase, "I amvery hungry.""I have the feeling of a great solitude around me," he continued."Is it, perhaps, because I am the only man with a definite ideain his head, in the complete collapse of every resolve,intention, and hope about me?  But the solitude is also veryreal. All the engineers are out, and have been for two days,looking after the property of the National Central Railway, ofthat great Costaguana undertaking which is to put money into thepockets of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Americans, Germans, and Godknows who else. The silence about me is ominous. There is abovethe middle part of this house a sort of first floor, with narrowopenings like loopholes for windows, probably used in old timesfor the better defence against the savages, when the persistentbarbarism of our native continent did not wear the black coats ofpoliticians, but went about yelling, half-naked, with bows andarrows in its hands. The woman of the house is dying up there, Ibelieve, all alone with her old husband. There is a narrowstaircase, the sort of staircase one man could easily defendagainst a mob, leading up there, and I have just heard, throughthe thickness of the wall, the old fellow going down into theirkitchen for something or other. It was a sort of noise a mousemight make behind the plaster of a wall.  All the servants theyhad ran away yesterday and have not returned yet, if ever theydo. For the rest, there are only two children here, two girls.The father has sent them downstairs, and they have crept intothis cafe, perhaps because I am here. They huddle together in acorner, in each other's arms; I just noticed them a few minutesago, and I feel more lonely than ever."Decoud turned half round in his chair, and asked, "Is there anybread here?"Linda's dark head was shaken negatively in response, above thefair head of her sister nestling on her breast."You couldn't get me some bread?" insisted Decoud.  The child didnot move; he saw her large eyes stare at him very dark from thecorner. "You're not afraid of me?" he said."No," said Linda, "we are not afraid of you. You came here withGian' Battista.""You mean Nostromo?" said Decoud."The English call him so, but that is no name either for man orbeast," said the girl, passing her hand gently over her sister'shair."But he lets people call him so," remarked Decoud."Not in this house," retorted the child."Ah! well, I shall call him the Capataz then."Decoud gave up the point, and after writing steadily for a whileturned round again."When do you expect him back?" he asked."After he brought you here he rode off to fetch the Senor Doctorfrom the town for mother. He will be back soon.""He stands a good chance of getting shot somewhere on the road,"Decoud murmured to himself audibly; and Linda declared in herhigh-pitched voice--"Nobody would dare to fire a shot at Gian' Battista.""You believe that," asked Decoud, "do you?""I know it," said the child, with conviction. "There is no one inthis place brave enough to attack Gian' Battista.""It doesn't require much bravery to pull a trigger behind abush," muttered Decoud to himself. "Fortunately, the night isdark, or there would be but little chance of saving the silver ofthe mine."He turned again to his pocket-book, glanced back through thepages, and again started his pencil."That was the position yesterday, after the Minerva with thefugitive President had gone out of harbour, and the rioters hadbeen driven back into the side lanes of the town. I sat on thesteps of the cathedral with Nostromo, after sending out the cablemessage for the information of a more or less attentive world.Strangely enough, though the offices of the Cable Company are inthe same building as the Porvenir, the mob, which has thrown mypresses out of the window and scattered the type all over thePlaza, has been kept from interfering with the instruments on theother side of the courtyard. As I sat talking with Nostromo,Bernhardt, the telegraphist, came out from under the Arcades witha piece of paper in his hand. The little man had tied himself upto an enormous sword and was hung all over with revolvers. He isridiculous, but the bravest German of his size that ever tappedthe key of a Morse transmitter. He had received the message fromCayta reporting the transports with Barrios's army just enteringthe port, and ending with the words, 'The greatest enthusiasmprevails.' I walked off to drink some water at the fountain, andI was shot at from the Alameda by somebody hiding behind a tree.But I drank, and didn't care; with Barrios in Cayta and the greatCordillera between us and Montero's victorious army I seemed,notwithstanding Messrs. Gamacho and Fuentes, to hold my new Statein the hollow of my hand. I was ready to sleep, but when I got asfar as the Casa Gould I found the patio full of wounded laid outon straw. Lights were burning, and in that enclosed courtyard onthat hot night a faint odour of chloroform and blood hung about.At one end Doctor Monygham, the doctor of the mine, was dressingthe wounds; at the other, near the stairs, Father Corbelan,kneeling, listened to the confession of a dying Cargador. Mrs.Gould was walking about through these shambles with a largebottle in one hand and a lot of cotton wool in the other. Shejust looked at me and never even winked.  Her camerista wasfollowing her, also holding a bottle, and sobbing gently toherself."I busied myself for some time in fetching water from the cisternfor the wounded. Afterwards I wandered upstairs, meeting some ofthe first ladies of Sulaco, paler than I had ever seen thembefore, with bandages over their arms. Not all of them had fledto the ships. A good many had taken refuge for the day in theCasa Gould. On the landing a girl, with her hair half down, waskneeling against the wall under the niche where stands a Madonnain blue robes and a gilt crown on her head. I think it was theeldest Miss Lopez; I couldn't see her face, but I rememberlooking at the high French heel of her little shoe. She did notmake a sound, she did not stir, she was not sobbing; she remainedthere, perfectly still, all black against the white wall, asilent figure of passionate piety. I am sure she was no morefrightened than the other white-faced ladies I met carryingbandages. One was sitting on the top step tearing a piece oflinen hastily into strips--the young wife of an elderly man offortune here.  She interrupted herself to wave her hand to mybow, as though she were in her carriage on the Alameda. The womenof our country are worth looking at during a revolution. Therouge and pearl powder fall off, together with that passiveattitude towards the outer world which education, tradition,custom impose upon them from the earliest infancy. I thought ofyour face, which from your infancy had the stamp of intelligenceinstead of that patient and resigned cast which appears when somepolitical commotion tears down the veil of cosmetics and usage."In the great sala upstairs a sort of Junta of Notables wassitting, the remnant of the vanished Provincial Assembly. DonJuste Lopez had had half his beard singed off at the muzzle of atrabuco loaded with slugs, of which every one missed him,providentially. And as he turned his head from side to side itwas exactly as if there had been two men inside his frock-coat,one nobly whiskered and solemn, the other untidy and scared."They raised a cry of 'Decoud! Don Martin!' at my entrance. Iasked them, 'What are you deliberating upon, gentlemen?' Theredid not seem to be any president, though Don Jose Avellanos satat the head of the table. They all answered together, 'On thepreservation of life and property.' 'Till the new officialsarrive,' Don Juste explained to me, with the solemn side of hisface offered to my view. It was as if a stream of water had beenpoured upon my glowing idea of a new State. There was a hissingsound in my ears, and the room grew dim, as if suddenly filledwith vapour."I walked up to the table blindly, as though I had been drunk.'You are deliberating upon surrender,' I said. They all satstill, with their noses over the sheet of paper each had beforehim, God only knows why. Only Don Jose hid his face in his hands,muttering, 'Never, never!' But as I looked at him, it seemed tome that I could have blown him away with my breath, he looked sofrail, so weak, so worn out.  Whatever happens, he will notsurvive. The deception is too great for a man of his age; andhasn't he seen the sheets of 'Fifty Years of Misrule,' which wehave begun printing on the presses of the Porvenir, littering thePlaza, floating in the gutters, fired out as wads for trabucosloaded with handfuls of type, blown in the wind, trampled in themud? I have seen pages floating upon the very waters of theharbour. It would be unreasonable to expect him to survive. Itwould be cruel."'Do you know,' I cried, 'what surrender means to you, to yourwomen, to your children, to your property?'"I declaimed for five minutes without drawing breath, it seems tome, harping on our best chances, on the ferocity of Montero, whomI made out to be as great a beast as I have no doubt he wouldlike to be if he had intelligence enough to conceive a systematicreign of terror. And then for another five minutes or more Ipoured out an impassioned appeal to their courage and manliness,with all the passion of my love for Antonia. For if ever manspoke well, it would be from a personal feeling, denouncing anenemy, defending himself, or pleading for what really may bedearer than life. My dear girl, I absolutely thundered at them.It seemed as if my voice would burst the walls asunder, and whenI stopped I saw all their scared eyes looking at me dubiously.And that was all the effect I had produced! Only Don Jose's headhad sunk lower and lower on his breast. I bent my ear to hiswithered lips, and made out his whisper, something like, 'InGod's name, then, Martin, my son!' I don't know exactly.  Therewas the name of God in it, I am certain. It seems to me I havecaught his last breath--the breath of his departing soul on hislips."He lives yet, it is true. I have seen him since; but it was onlya senile body, lying on its back, covered to the chin, with openeyes, and so still that you might have said it was breathing nolonger. I left him thus, with Antonia kneeling by the side of thebed, just before I came to this Italian's posada, where theubiquitous death is also waiting. But I know that Don Jose hasreally died there, in the Casa Gould, with that whisper urging meto attempt what no doubt his soul, wrapped up in the sanctity ofdiplomatic treaties and solemn declarations, must have abhorred.I had exclaimed very loud, 'There is never any God in a countrywhere men will not help themselves.'"Meanwhile, Don Juste had begun a pondered oration whose solemneffect was spoiled by the ridiculous disaster to his beard. I didnot wait to make it out.  He seemed to argue that Montero's (hecalled him The General) intentions were probably not evil,though, he went on, 'that distinguished man' (only a week ago weused to call him a gran' bestia) 'was perhaps mistaken as to thetrue means.' As you may imagine, I didn't stay to hear the rest.I know the intentions of Montero's brother, Pedrito, theguerrillero, whom I exposed in Paris, some years ago, in a cafefrequented by South American students, where he tried to passhimself off for a Secretary of Legation. He used to come in andtalk for hours, twisting his felt hat in his hairy paws, and hisambition seemed to become a sort of Duc de Morny to a sort ofNapoleon. Already, then, he used to talk of his brother ininflated terms. He seemed fairly safe from being found out,because the students, all of the Blanco families, did not, as youmay imagine, frequent the Legation. It was only Decoud, a manwithout faith and principles, as they used to say, that went inthere sometimes for the sake of the fun, as it were to anassembly of trained monkeys. I know his intentions. I have seenhim change the plates at table.  Whoever is allowed to live on interror, I must die the death."No, I didn't stay to the end to hear Don Juste Lopez trying topersuade himself in a grave oration of the clemency and justice,and honesty, and purity of the brothers Montero. I went outabruptly to seek Antonia. I saw her in the gallery. As I openedthe door, she extended to me her clasped hands."'What are they doing in there?' she asked."'Talking,' I said, with my eyes looking into hers."'Yes, yes, but--'"'Empty speeches,' I interrupted her. 'Hiding their fears behindimbecile hopes. They are all great Parliamentarians there--on theEnglish model, as you know.' I was so furious that I could hardlyspeak.  She made a gesture of despair."Through the door I held a little ajar behind me, we heard DunJuste's measured mouthing monotone go on from phrase to phrase,like a sort of awful and solemn madness."'After all, the Democratic aspirations have, perhaps, theirlegitimacy. The ways of human progress are inscrutable, and ifthe fate of the country is in the hand of Montero, we ought--'"I crashed the door to on that; it was enough; it was too much.There was never a beautiful face expressing more horror anddespair than the face of Antonia. I couldn't bear it; I seizedher wrists."'Have they killed my father in there?' she asked."Her eyes blazed with indignation, but as I looked on,fascinated, the light in them went out."'It is a surrender,' I said. And I remember I was shaking herwrists I held apart in my hands. 'But it's more than talk. Yourfather told me to go on in God's name.'"My dear girl, there is that in Antonia which would make mebelieve in the feasibility of anything. One look at her face isenough to set my brain on fire. And yet I love her as any otherman would--with the heart, and with that alone. She is more to methan his Church to Father Corbelan (the Grand Vicar disappearedlast night from the town; perhaps gone to join the band ofHernandez). She is more to me than his precious mine to thatsentimental Englishman. I won't speak of his wife. She may havebeen sentimental once.  The San Tome mine stands now betweenthose two people.  'Your father himself, Antonia,' I repeated;'your father, do you understand? has told me to go on.'"She averted her face, and in a pained voice--"'He has?' she cried. 'Then, indeed, I fear he will never speakagain.'"She freed her wrists from my clutch and began to cry in herhandkerchief. I disregarded her sorrow; I would rather see hermiserable than not see her at all, never any more; for whether Iescaped or stayed to die, there was for us no coming together, nofuture. And that being so, I had no pity to waste upon thepassing moments of her sorrow. I sent her off in tears to fetchDona Emilia and Don Carlos, too. Their sentiment was necessary tothe very life of my plan; the sentimentalism of the people thatwill never do anything for the sake of their passionate desire,unless it comes to them clothed in the fair robes of an idea."Late at night we formed a small junta of four--the two women,Don Carlos, and myself--in Mrs. Gould's blue-and-white boudoir."El Rey de Sulaco thinks himself, no doubt, a very honest man.And so he is, if one could look behind his taciturnity. Perhapshe thinks that this alone makes his honesty unstained. ThoseEnglishmen live on illusions which somehow or other help them toget a firm hold of the substance. When he speaks it is by a rare'yes' or 'no' that seems as impersonal as the words of an oracle.But he could not impose on me by his dumb reserve. I knew what hehad in his head; he has his mine in his head; and his wife hadnothing in her head but his precious person, which he has boundup with the Gould Concession and tied up to that little woman'sneck. No matter. The thing was to make him present the affair toHolroyd (the Steel and Silver King) in such a manner as to securehis financial support.  At that time last night, just twenty-fourhours ago, we thought the silver of the mine safe in the CustomHouse vaults till the north-bound steamer came to take it away.And as long as the treasure flowed north, without a break, thatutter sentimentalist, Holroyd, would not drop his idea ofintroducing, not only justice, industry, peace, to the benightedcontinents, but also that pet dream of his of a purer form ofChristianity. Later on, the principal European really in Sulaco,the engineer-in-chief of the railway, came riding up the Calle,from the harbour, and was admitted to our conclave. Meantime, theJunta of the Notables in the great sala was still deliberating;only, one of them had run out in the corredor to ask the servantwhether something to eat couldn't be sent in. The first words theengineer-in-chief said as he came into the boudoir were, 'What isyour house, dear Mrs. Gould? A war hospital below, and apparentlya restaurant above.  I saw them carrying trays full of goodthings into the sala.'"'And here, in this boudoir,' I said, 'you behold the innercabinet of the Occidental Republic that is to be.'"He was so preoccupied that he didn't smile at that, he didn'teven look surprised."He told us that he was attending to the general dispositions forthe defence of the railway property at the railway yards when hewas sent for to go into the railway telegraph office.  Theengineer of the railhead, at the foot of the mountains, wanted totalk to him from his end of the wire. There was nobody in theoffice but himself and the operator of the railway telegraph, whoread off the clicks aloud as the tape coiled its length upon thefloor. And the purport of that talk, clicked nervously from awooden shed in the depths of the forests, had informed the chiefthat President Ribiera had been, or was being, pursued. This wasnews, indeed, to all of us in Sulaco. Ribiera himself, whenrescued, revived, and soothed by us, had been inclined to thinkthat he had not been pursued."Ribiera had yielded to the urgent solicitations of his friends,and had left the headquarters of his discomfited army alone,under the guidance of Bonifacio, the muleteer, who had beenwilling to take the responsibility with the risk. He had departedat daybreak of the third day. His remaining forces had meltedaway during the night. Bonifacio and he rode hard on horsestowards the Cordillera; then they obtained mules, entered thepasses, and crossed the Paramo of Ivie just before a freezingblast swept over that stony plateau, burying in a drift of snowthe little shelter-hut of stones in which they had spent thenight.  Afterwards poor Ribiera had many adventures, gotseparated from his guide, lost his mount, struggled down to theCampo on foot, and if he had not thrown himself on the mercy of aranchero would have perished a long way from Sulaco. That man,who, as a matter of fact, recognized him at once, let him have afresh mule, which the fugitive, heavy and unskilful, had riddento death.  And it was true he had been pursued by a partycommanded by no less a person than Pedro Montero, the brother ofthe general. The cold wind of the Paramo luckily caught thepursuers on the top of the pass.  Some few men, and all theanimals, perished in the icy blast. The stragglers died, but themain body kept on.  They found poor Bonifacio lying half-dead atthe foot of a snow slope, and bayoneted him promptly in the trueCivil War style. They would have had Ribiera, too, if they hadnot, for some reason or other, turned off the track of the oldCamino Real, only to lose their way in the forests at the foot ofthe lower slopes.  And there they were at last, having stumbledin unexpectedly upon the construction camp. The engineer at therailhead told his chief by wire that he had Pedro Monteroabsolutely there, in the very office, listening to the clicks. Hewas going to take possession of Sulaco in the name of theDemocracy. He was very overbearing.  His men slaughtered some ofthe Railway Company's cattle without asking leave, and went towork broiling the meat on the embers. Pedrito made many pointedinquiries as to the silver mine, and what had become of theproduct of the last six months' working.  He had saidperemptorily, "Ask your chief up there by wire, he ought to know;tell him that Don Pedro Montero, Chief of the Campo and Ministerof the Interior of the new Government, desires to be correctlyinformed.'"He had his feet wrapped up in blood-stained rags, a lean,haggard face, ragged beard and hair, and had walked in limping,with a crooked branch of a tree for a staff. His followers wereperhaps in a worse plight, but apparently they had not thrownaway their arms, and, at any rate, not all their ammunition.Their lean faces filled the door and the windows of the telegraphhut. As it was at the same time the bedroom of theengineer-in-charge there, Montero had thrown himself on his cleanblankets and lay there shivering and dictating requisitions to betransmitted by wire to Sulaco.  He demanded a train of cars to besent down at once to transport his men up."'To this I answered from my end,' the engineer-in-chief relatedto us, 'that I dared not risk the rolling-stock in the interior,as there had been attempts to wreck trains all along the lineseveral times. I did that for your sake, Gould,' said the chiefengineer. 'The answer to this was, in the words of mysubordinate, "The filthy brute on my bed said, 'Suppose I were tohave you shot?'" To which my subordinate, who, it appears, washimself operating, remarked that it would not bring the cars up.Upon that, the other, yawning, said, "Never mind, there is nolack of horses on the Campo." And, turning over, went to sleep onHarris's bed.'"This is why, my dear girl, I am a fugitive to-night.  The lastwire from railhead says that Pedro Montero and his men left atdaybreak, after feeding on asado beef all night. They took allthe horses; they will find more on the road; they'll be here inless than thirty hours, and thus Sulaco is no place either for meor the great store of silver belonging to the Gould Concession."But that is not the worst. The garrison of Esmeralda has goneover to the victorious party. We have heard this by means of thetelegraphist of the Cable Company, who came to the Casa Gould inthe early morning with the news. In fact, it was so early thatthe day had not yet quite broken over Sulaco. His colleague inEsmeralda had called him up to say that the garrison, aftershooting some of their officers, had taken possession of aGovernment steamer laid up in the harbour. It is really a heavyblow for me. I thought I could depend on every man in thisprovince.  It was a mistake. It was a Monterist Revolution inEsmeralda, just such as was attempted in Sulaco, only that thatone came off. The telegraphist was signalling to Bernhardt allthe time, and his last transmitted words were, 'They are burstingin the door, and taking possession of the cable office. You arecut off. Can do no more.'"But, as a matter of fact, he managed somehow to escape thevigilance of his captors, who had tried to stop the communicationwith the outer world. He did manage it. How it was done I don'tknow, but a few hours afterwards he called up Sulaco again, andwhat he said was, 'The insurgent army has taken possession of theGovernment transport in the bay and are filling her with troops,with the intention of going round the coast to Sulaco. Thereforelook out for yourselves.  They will be ready to start in a fewhours, and may be upon you before daybreak.'"This is all he could say. They drove him away from hisinstrument this time for good, because Bernhardt has been callingup Esmeralda ever since without getting an answer."After setting these words down in the pocket-book which he wasfilling up for the benefit of his sister, Decoud lifted his headto listen. But there were no sounds, neither in the room nor inthe house, except the drip of the water from the filter into thevast earthenware jar under the wooden stand. And outside thehouse there was a great silence. Decoud lowered his head againover the pocket-book."I am not running away, you understand," he wrote on. "I amsimply going away with that great treasure of silver which mustbe saved at all costs. Pedro Montero from the Campo and therevolted garrison of Esmeralda from the sea are converging uponit. That it is there lying ready for them is only an accident.The real objective is the San Tome mine itself, as you may wellimagine; otherwise the Occidental Province would have been, nodoubt, left alone for many weeks, to be gathered at leisure intothe arms of the victorious party.  Don Carlos Gould will haveenough to do to save his mine, with its organization and itspeople; this 'Imperium in Imperio,' this wealth-producing thing,to which his sentimentalism attaches a strange idea of justice.He holds to it as some men hold to the idea of love or revenge.Unless I am much mistaken in the man, it must remain inviolate orperish by an act of his will alone. A passion has crept into hiscold and idealistic life. A passion which I can only comprehendintellectually. A passion that is not like the passions we know,we men of another blood. But it is as dangerous as any of ours."His wife has understood it, too. That is why she is such a goodally of mine. She seizes upon all my suggestions with a sureinstinct that in the end they make for the safety of the GouldConcession. And he defers to her because he trusts her perhaps,but I fancy rather as if he wished to make up for some subtlewrong, for that sentimental unfaithfulness which surrenders herhappiness, her life, to the seduction of an idea. The littlewoman has discovered that he lives for the mine rather than forher. But let them be. To each his fate, shaped by passion orsentiment. The principal thing is that she has backed up myadvice to get the silver out of the town, out of the country, atonce, at any cost, at any risk. Don Carlos' mission is topreserve unstained the fair fame of his mine; Mrs. Gould'smission is to save him from the effects of that cold andovermastering passion, which she dreads more than if it were aninfatuation for another woman. Nostromo's mission is to save thesilver. The plan is to load it into the largest of the Company'slighters, and send it across the gulf to a small port out ofCostaguana territory just on the other side the Azuera, where thefirst northbound steamer will get orders to pick it up. Thewaters here are calm. We shall slip away into the darkness of thegulf before the Esmeralda rebels arrive; and by the time the daybreaks over the ocean we shall be out of sight, invisible, hiddenby Azuera, which itself looks from the Sulaco shore like a faintblue cloud on the horizon."The incorruptible Capataz de Cargadores is the man for thatwork; and I, the man with a passion, but without a mission, I gowith him to return--to play my part in the farce to the end, and,if successful, to receive my reward, which no one but Antonia cangive me."I shall not see her again now before I depart. I left her, as Ihave said, by Don Jose's bedside. The street was dark, the housesshut up, and I walked out of the town in the night. Not a singlestreet-lamp had been lit for two days, and the archway of thegate was only a mass of darkness in the vague form of a tower, inwhich I heard low, dismal groans, that seemed to answer themurmurs of a man's voice."I recognized something impassive and careless in its tone,characteristic of that Genoese sailor who, like me, has comecasually here to be drawn into the events for which hisscepticism as well as mine seems to entertain a sort of passivecontempt. The only thing he seems to care for, as far as I havebeen able to discover, is to be well spoken of. An ambition fitfor noble souls, but also a profitable one for an exceptionallyintelligent scoundrel. Yes. His very words, 'To be well spokenof. Si, senor.' He does not seem to make any difference betweenspeaking and thinking. Is it sheer naiveness or the practicalpoint of view, I wonder?  Exceptional individualities alwaysinterest me, because they are true to the general formulaexpressing the moral state of humanity."He joined me on the harbour road after I had passed them underthe dark archway without stopping.  It was a woman in trouble hehad been talking to.  Through discretion I kept silent while hewalked by my side. After a time he began to talk himself. It wasnot what I expected. It was only an old woman, an old lace-maker,in search of her son, one of the street-sweepers employed by themunicipality. Friends had come the day before at daybreak to thedoor of their hovel calling him out. He had gone with them, andshe had not seen him since; so she had left the food she had beenpreparing half-cooked on the extinct embers and had crawled outas far as the harbour, where she had heard that some town mozoshad been killed on the morning of the riot. One of the Cargadoresguarding the Custom House had brought out a lantern, and hadhelped her to look at the few dead left lying about there.  Nowshe was creeping back, having failed in her search.  So she satdown on the stone seat under the arch, moaning, because she wasvery tired. The Capataz had questioned her, and after hearing herbroken and groaning tale had advised her to go and look amongstthe wounded in the patio of the Casa Gould. He had also given hera quarter dollar, he mentioned carelessly.""'Why did you do that?' I asked. 'Do you know her?'"'No, senor. I don't suppose I have ever seen her before. Howshould I? She has not probably been out in the streets for years.She is one of those old women that you find in this country atthe back of huts, crouching over fireplaces, with a stick on theground by their side, and almost too feeble to drive away thestray dogs from their cooking-pots. Caramba! I could tell by hervoice that death had forgotten her.  But, old or young, they likemoney, and will speak well of the man who gives it to them.' Helaughed a little.  'Senor, you should have felt the clutch of herpaw as I put the piece in her palm.' He paused. 'My last, too,'he added."I made no comment. He's known for his liberality and his badluck at the game of monte, which keeps him as poor as when hefirst came here."'I suppose, Don Martin,' he began, in a thoughtful, speculativetone, 'that the Senor Administrador of San Tome will reward mesome day if I save his silver?'"I said that it could not be otherwise, surely. He walked on,muttering to himself. 'Si, si, without doubt, without doubt; and,look you, Senor Martin, what it is to be well spoken of! There isnot another man that could have been even thought of for such athing. I shall get something great for it some day. And let itcome soon,' he mumbled. 'Time passes in this country as quick asanywhere else.'"This, soeur cherie, is my companion in the great escape for thesake of the great cause. He is more naive than shrewd, moremasterful than crafty, more generous with his personality thanthe people who make use of him are with their money. At least,that is what he thinks himself with more pride than sentiment. Iam glad I have made friends with him. As a companion he acquiresmore importance than he ever had as a sort of minor genius in hisway--as an original Italian sailor whom I allowed to come in inthe small hours and talk familiarly to the editor of the Porvenirwhile the paper was going through the press. And it is curious tohave met a man for whom the value of life seems to consist inpersonal prestige."I am waiting for him here now. On arriving at the posada kept byViola we found the children alone down below, and the old Genoeseshouted to his countryman to go and fetch the doctor. Otherwisewe would have gone on to the wharf, where it appears CaptainMitchell with some volunteer Europeans and a few pickedCargadores are loading the lighter with the silver that must besaved from Montero's clutches in order to be used for Montero'sdefeat. Nostromo galloped furiously back towards the town. He hasbeen long gone already. This delay gives me time to talk to you.By the time this pocket-book reaches your hands much will havehappened. But now it is a pause under the hovering wing of deathin this silent house buried in the black night, with this dyingwoman, the two children crouching without a sound, and that oldman whom I can hear through the thickness of the wall passing upand down with a light rubbing noise no louder than a mouse. AndI, the only other with them, don't really know whether to countmyself with the living or with the dead. 'Quien sabe?' as thepeople here are prone to say in answer to every question. But no!feeling for you is certainly not dead, and the whole thing, thehouse, the dark night, the silent children in this dim room, myvery presence here--all this is life, must be life, since it isso much like a dream."With the writing of the last line there came upon Decoud a momentof sudden and complete oblivion.  He swayed over the table as ifstruck by a bullet. The next moment he sat up, confused, with theidea that he had heard his pencil roll on the floor. The low doorof the cafe, wide open, was filled with the glare of a torch inwhich was visible half of a horse, switching its tail against theleg of a rider with a long iron spur strapped to the naked heel.The two girls were gone, and Nostromo, standing in the middle ofthe room, looked at him from under the round brim of the sombrerolow down over his brow."I have brought that sour-faced English doctor in Senora Gould'scarriage," said Nostromo. "I doubt if, with all his wisdom, hecan save the Padrona this time.  They have sent for the children.A bad sign that."He sat down on the end of a bench. "She wants to give them herblessing, I suppose."Dazedly Decoud observed that he must have fallen sound asleep,and Nostromo said, with a vague smile, that he had looked in atthe window and had seen him lying still across the table with hishead on his arms.  The English senora had also come in thecarriage, and went upstairs at once with the doctor. She had toldhim not to wake up Don Martin yet; but when they sent for thechildren he had come into the cafe.The half of the horse with its half of the rider swung roundoutside the door; the torch of tow and resin in the iron basketwhich was carried on a stick at the saddle-bow flared right intothe room for a moment, and Mrs.  Gould entered hastily with avery white, tired face.  The hood of her dark, blue cloak hadfallen back. Both men rose."Teresa wants to see you, Nostromo," she said.  The Capataz didnot move. Decoud, with his back to the table, began to button uphis coat."The silver, Mrs. Gould, the silver," he murmured in English."Don't forget that the Esmeralda garrison have got a steamer.They may appear at any moment at the harbour entrance.""The doctor says there is no hope," Mrs. Gould spoke rapidly,also in English. "I shall take you down to the wharf in mycarriage and then come back to fetch away the girls." She changedswiftly into Spanish to address Nostromo. "Why are you wastingtime? Old Giorgio's wife wishes to see you.""I am going to her, senora," muttered the Capataz.  Dr. Monyghamnow showed himself, bringing back the children. To Mrs. Gould'sinquiring glance he only shook his head and went outside at once,followed by Nostromo.The horse of the torch-bearer, motionless, hung his head low, andthe rider had dropped the reins to light a cigarette. The glareof the torch played on the front of the house crossed by the bigblack letters of its inscription in which only the word ITALIAwas lighted fully. The patch of wavering glare reached as far asMrs. Gould's carriage waiting on the road, with the yellow-faced,portly Ignacio apparently dozing on the box. By his side Basilio,dark and skinny, held a Winchester carbine in front of him, withboth hands, and peered fearfully into the darkness. Nostromotouched lightly the doctor's shoulder."Is she really dying, senor doctor?""Yes," said the doctor, with a strange twitch of his scarredcheek. "And why she wants to see you I cannot imagine.""She has been like that before," suggested Nostromo, lookingaway."Well, Capataz, I can assure you she will never be like thatagain," snarled Dr. Monygham. "You may go to her or stay away.There is very little to be got from talking to the dying. But shetold Dona Emilia in my hearing that she has been like a mother toyou ever since you first set foot ashore here.""Si! And she never had a good word to say for me to anybody. Itis more as if she could not forgive me for being alive, and sucha man, too, as she would have liked her son to be.""Maybe!" exclaimed a mournful deep voice near them. "Women havetheir own ways of tormenting themselves." Giorgio Viola had comeout of the house.  He threw a heavy black shadow in thetorchlight, and the glare fell on his big face, on the greatbushy head of white hair. He motioned the Capataz indoors withhis extended arm.Dr. Monygham, after busying himself with a little medicament boxof polished wood on the seat of the landau, turned to old Giorgioand thrust into his big, trembling hand one of theglass-stoppered bottles out of the case."Give her a spoonful of this now and then, in water," he said."It will make her easier.""And there is nothing more for her?" asked the old man,patiently."No. Not on earth," said the doctor, with his back to him,clicking the lock of the medicine case.Nostromo slowly crossed the large kitchen, all dark but for theglow of a heap of charcoal under the heavy mantel of thecooking-range, where water was boiling in an iron pot with a loudbubbling sound. Between the two walls of a narrow staircase abright light streamed from the sick-room above; and themagnificent Capataz de Cargadores stepping noiselessly in softleather sandals, bushy whiskered, his muscular neck and bronzedchest bare in the open check shirt, resembled a Mediterraneansailor just come ashore from some wine or fruit-laden felucca. Atthe top he paused, broad shouldered, narrow hipped and supple,looking at the large bed, like a white couch of state, with aprofusion of snowy linen, amongst which the Padrona sat unproppedand bowed, her handsome, black-browed face bent over her chest. Amass of raven hair with only a few white threads in it coveredher shoulders; one thick strand fallen forward half veiled hercheek.  Perfectly motionless in that pose, expressing physicalanxiety and unrest, she turned her eyes alone towards Nostromo.The Capataz had a red sash wound many times round his waist, anda heavy silver ring on the forefinger of the hand he raised togive a twist to his moustache."Their revolutions, their revolutions," gasped Senora Teresa."Look, Gian' Battista, it has killed me at last!"Nostromo said nothing, and the sick woman with an upward glanceinsisted. "Look, this one has killed me, while you were awayfighting for what did not concern you, foolish man.""Why talk like this?" mumbled the Capataz between his teeth."Will you never believe in my good sense?  It concerns me to keepon being what I am: every day alike.""You never change, indeed," she said, bitterly. "Always thinkingof yourself and taking your pay out in fine words from those whocare nothing for you."There was between them an intimacy of antagonism as close in itsway as the intimacy of accord and affection.  He had not walkedalong the way of Teresa's expectations. It was she who hadencouraged him to leave his ship, in the hope of securing afriend and defender for the girls. The wife of old Giorgio wasaware of her precarious health, and was haunted by the fear ofher aged husband's loneliness and the unprotected state of thechildren. She had wanted to annex that apparently quiet andsteady young man, affectionate and pliable, an orphan from histenderest age, as he had told her, with no ties in Italy exceptan uncle, owner and master of a felucca, from whose ill-usage hehad run away before he was fourteen. He had seemed to hercourageous, a hard worker, determined to make his way in theworld. From gratitude and the ties of habit he would become likea son to herself and Giorgio; and then, who knows, when Linda hadgrown up. . . .  Ten years' difference between husband and wifewas not so much. Her own great man was nearly twenty years olderthan herself. Gian' Battista was an attractive young fellow,besides; attractive to men, women, and children, just by thatprofound quietness of personality which, like a serene twilight,rendered more seductive the promise of his vigorous form and theresolution of his conduct.Old Giorgio, in profound ignorance of his wife's views and hopes,had a great regard for his young countryman.  "A man ought not tobe tame," he used to tell her, quoting the Spanish proverb indefence of the splendid Capataz. She was growing jealous of hissuccess. He was escaping from her, she feared. She was practical,and he seemed to her to be an absurd spendthrift of thesequalities which made him so valuable. He got too little for them.He scattered them with both hands amongst too many people, shethought. He laid no money by. She railed at his poverty, hisexploits, his adventures, his loves and his reputation; but inher heart she had never given him up, as though, indeed, he hadbeen her son.Even now, ill as she was, ill enough to feel the chill, blackbreath of the approaching end, she had wished to see him. It waslike putting out her benumbed hand to regain her hold. But shehad presumed too much on her strength. She could not command herthoughts; they had become dim, like her vision. The wordsfaltered on her lips, and only the paramount anxiety and desireof her life seemed to be too strong for death.The Capataz said, "I have heard these things many times. You areunjust, but it does not hurt me. Only now you do not seem to havemuch strength to talk, and I have but little time to listen. I amengaged in a work of very great moment."She made an effort to ask him whether it was true that he hadfound time to go and fetch a doctor for her.  Nostromo noddedaffirmatively.She was pleased: it relieved her sufferings to know that the manhad condescended to do so much for those who really wanted hishelp. It was a proof of his friendship. Her voice becomestronger."I want a priest more than a doctor," she said, pathetically. Shedid not move her head; only her eyes ran into the corners towatch the Capataz standing by the side of her bed. "Would you goto fetch a priest for me now? Think! A dying woman asks you!"Nostromo shook his head resolutely. He did not believe in priestsin their sacerdotal character. A doctor was an efficaciousperson; but a priest, as priest, was nothing, incapable of doingeither good or harm.  Nostromo did not even dislike the sight ofthem as old Giorgio did. The utter uselessness of the errand waswhat struck him most."Padrona," he said, "you have been like this before, and gotbetter after a few days. I have given you already the very lastmoments I can spare. Ask Senora Gould to send you one."He was feeling uneasy at the impiety of this refusal.  ThePadrona believed in priests, and confessed herself to them. Butall women did that. It could not be of much consequence. And yethis heart felt oppressed for a moment--at the thought whatabsolution would mean to her if she believed in it only ever solittle. No matter. It was quite true that he had given heralready the very last moment he could spare."You refuse to go?" she gasped. "Ah! you are always yourself,indeed.""Listen to reason, Padrona," he said. "I am needed to save thesilver of the mine. Do you hear? A greater treasure than the onewhich they say is guarded by ghosts and devils on Azuera. It istrue. I am resolved to make this the most desperate affair I wasever engaged on in my whole life."She felt a despairing indignation. The supreme test had failed.Standing above her, Nostromo did not see the distorted featuresof her face, distorted by a paroxysm of pain and anger. Only shebegan to tremble all over. Her bowed head shook. The broadshoulders quivered."Then God, perhaps, will have mercy upon me!  But do you look toit, man, that you get something for yourself out of it, besidesthe remorse that shall overtake you some day."She laughed feebly. "Get riches at least for once, youindispensable, admired Gian' Battista, to whom the peace of adying woman is less than the praise of people who have given youa silly name--and nothing besides--in exchange for your soul andbody."The Capataz de Cargadores swore to himself under his breath."Leave my soul alone, Padrona, and I shall know how to take careof my body. Where is the harm of people having need of me? Whatare you envying me that I have robbed you and the children of?Those very people you are throwing in my teeth have done more forold Giorgio than they ever thought of doing for me."He struck his breast with his open palm; his voice had remainedlow though he had spoken in a forcible tone. He twisted hismoustaches one after another, and his eyes wandered a littleabout the room."Is it my fault that I am the only man for their purposes?  Whatangry nonsense are you talking, mother?  Would you rather have metimid and foolish, selling water-melons on the market-place orrowing a boat for passengers along the harbour, like a softNeapolitan without courage or reputation? Would you have a youngman live like a monk? I do not believe it. Would you want a monkfor your eldest girl? Let her grow. What are you afraid of? Youhave been angry with me for everything I did for years; eversince you first spoke to me, in secret from old Giorgio, aboutyour Linda. Husband to one and brother to the other, did you say?Well, why not! I like the little ones, and a man must marry sometime. But ever since that time you have been making little of meto everyone. Why? Did you think you could put a collar and chainon me as if I were one of the watch-dogs they keep over there inthe railway yards? Look here, Padrona, I am the same man who cameashore one evening and sat down in the thatched ranche you livedin at that time on the other side of the town and told you allabout himself. You were not unjust to me then. What has happenedsince?  I am no longer an insignificant youth. A good name,Giorgio says, is a treasure, Padrona.""They have turned your head with their praises," gasped the sickwoman. "They have been paying you with words. Your folly shallbetray you into poverty, misery, starvation. The very leperosshall laugh at you--the great Capataz."Nostromo stood for a time as if struck dumb. She never looked athim. A self-confident, mirthless smile passed quickly from hislips, and then he backed away.  His disregarded figure sank downbeyond the doorway.  He descended the stairs backwards, with theusual sense of having been somehow baffled by this woman'sdisparagement of this reputation he had obtained and desired tokeep.Downstairs in the big kitchen a candle was burning, surrounded bythe shadows of the walls, of the ceiling, but no ruddy glarefilled the open square of the outer door. The carriage with Mrs.Gould and Don Martin, preceded by the horseman bearing the torch,had gone on to the jetty. Dr. Monygham, who had remained, sat onthe corner of a hard wood table near the candlestick, his seamed,shaven face inclined sideways, his arms crossed on his breast,his lips pursed up, and his prominent eyes glaring stonily uponthe floor of black earth. Near the overhanging mantel of thefireplace, where the pot of water was still boiling violently,old Giorgio held his chin in his hand, one foot advanced, as ifarrested by a sudden thought."Adios, viejo," said Nostromo, feeling the handle of his revolverin the belt and loosening his knife in its sheath. He picked up ablue poncho lined with red from the table, and put it over hishead. "Adios, look after the things in my sleeping-room, and ifyou hear from me no more, give up the box to Paquita. There isnot much of value there, except my new serape from Mexico, and afew silver buttons on my best jacket.  No matter!  The thingswill look well enough on the next lover she gets, and the manneed not be afraid I shall linger on earth after I am dead, likethose Gringos that haunt the Azuera."Dr. Monygham twisted his lips into a bitter smile.  After oldGiorgio, with an almost imperceptible nod and without a word, hadgone up the narrow stairs, he said--"Why, Capataz! I thought you could never fail in anything."Nostromo, glancing contemptuously at the doctor, lingered in thedoorway rolling a cigarette, then struck a match, and, afterlighting it, held the burning piece of wood above his head tillthe flame nearly touched his fingers."No wind!" he muttered to himself. "Look here, senor--do you knowthe nature of my undertaking?"Dr. Monygham nodded sourly."It is as if I were taking up a curse upon me, senor doctor. Aman with a treasure on this coast will have every knife raisedagainst him in every place upon the shore. You see that, senordoctor? I shall float along with a spell upon my life till I meetsomewhere the north-bound steamer of the Company, and then indeedthey will talk about the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores fromone end of America to another."Dr. Monygham laughed his short, throaty laugh.  Nostromo turnedround in the doorway."But if your worship can find any other man ready and fit forsuch business I will stand back. I am not exactly tired of mylife, though I am so poor that I can carry all I have with myselfon my horse's back.""You gamble too much, and never say 'no' to a pretty face,Capataz," said Dr. Monygham, with sly simplicity.  "That's notthe way to make a fortune. But nobody that I know ever suspectedyou of being poor.  I hope you have made a good bargain in caseyou come back safe from this adventure.""What bargain would your worship have made?" asked Nostromo,blowing the smoke out of his lips through the doorway.Dr. Monygham listened up the staircase for a moment before heanswered, with another of his short, abrupt laughs--"Illustrious Capataz, for taking the curse of death upon my back,as you call it, nothing else but the whole treasure would do."Nostromo vanished out of the doorway with a grunt of discontentat this jeering answer. Dr. Monygham heard him gallop away.Nostromo rode furiously in the dark. There were lights in thebuildings of the O.S.N. Company near the wharf, but before he gotthere he met the Gould carriage. The horseman preceded it withthe torch, whose light showed the white mules trotting, theportly Ignacio driving, and Basilio with the carbine on the box.From the dark body of the landau Mrs. Gould's voice cried, "Theyare waiting for you, Capataz!" She was returning, chilly andexcited, with Decoud's pocket-book still held in her hand.  Hehad confided it to her to send to his sister. "Perhaps my lastwords to her," he had said, pressing Mrs.  Gould's hand.The Capataz never checked his speed. At the head of the wharfvague figures with rifles leapt to the head of his horse; othersclosed upon him--cargadores of the company posted by CaptainMitchell on the watch. At a word from him they fell back withsubservient murmurs, recognizing his voice. At the other end ofthe jetty, near a cargo crane, in a dark group with glowingcigars, his name was pronounced in a tone of relief.  Most of theEuropeans in Sulaco were there, rallied round Charles Gould, asif the silver of the mine had been the emblem of a common cause,the symbol of the supreme importance of material interests. Theyhad loaded it into the lighter with their own hands. Nostromorecognized Don Carlos Gould, a thin, tall shape standing a littleapart and silent, to whom another tall shape, theengineer-in-chief, said aloud, "If it must be lost, it is amillion times better that it should go to the bottom of the sea."Martin Decoud called out from the lighter, "Au revoir, messieurs,till we clasp hands again over the new-born Occidental Republic."Only a subdued murmur responded to his clear, ringing tones; andthen it seemed to him that the wharf was floating away into thenight; but it was Nostromo, who was already pushing against apile with one of the heavy sweeps. Decoud did not move; theeffect was that of being launched into space. After a splash ortwo there was not a sound but the thud of Nostromo's feet leapingabout the boat.  He hoisted the big sail; a breath of wind fannedDecoud's cheek. Everything had vanished but the light of thelantern Captain Mitchell had hoisted upon the post at the end ofthe jetty to guide Nostromo out of the harbour.The two men, unable to see each other, kept silent till thelighter, slipping before the fitful breeze, passed out betweenalmost invisible headlands into the still deeper darkness of thegulf. For a time the lantern on the jetty shone after them. Thewind failed, then fanned up again, but so faintly that the big,half-decked boat slipped along with no more noise than if she hadbeen suspended in the air."We are out in the gulf now," said the calm voice of Nostromo. Amoment after he added, "Senor Mitchell has lowered the light.""Yes," said Decoud; "nobody can find us now."A great recrudescence of obscurity embraced the boat. The sea inthe gulf was as black as the clouds above. Nostromo, afterstriking a couple of matches to get a glimpse of the boat-compasshe had with him in the lighter, steered by the feel of the windon his cheek.It was a new experience for Decoud, this mysteriousness of thegreat waters spread out strangely smooth, as if theirrestlessness had been crushed by the weight of that dense night.The Placido was sleeping profoundly under its black poncho.The main thing now for success was to get away from the coast andgain the middle of the gulf before day broke. The Isabels weresomewhere at hand. "On your left as you look forward, senor,"said Nostromo, suddenly. When his voice ceased, the enormousstillness, without light or sound, seemed to affect Decoud'ssenses like a powerful drug. He didn't even know at times whetherhe were asleep or awake. Like a man lost in slumber, he heardnothing, he saw nothing.  Even his hand held before his face didnot exist for his eyes. The change from the agitation, thepassions and the dangers, from the sights and sounds of theshore, was so complete that it would have resembled death had itnot been for the survival of his thoughts. In this foretaste ofeternal peace they floated vivid and light, like unearthly cleardreams of earthly things that may haunt the souls freed by deathfrom the misty atmosphere of regrets and hopes. Decoud shookhimself, shuddered a bit, though the air that drifted past himwas warm. He had the strangest sensation of his soul having justreturned into his body from the circumambient darkness in whichland, sea, sky, the mountains, and the rocks were as if they hadnot been.Nostromo's voice was speaking, though he, at the tiller, was alsoas if he were not. "Have you been asleep, Don Martin? Caramba! Ifit were possible I would think that I, too, have dozed off.   Ihave a strange notion somehow of having dreamt that there was asound of blubbering, a sound a sorrowing man could make,somewhere near this boat. Something between a sigh and a sob.""Strange!" muttered Decoud, stretched upon the pile of treasureboxes covered by many tarpaulins.  "Could it be that there isanother boat near us in the gulf? We could not see it, you know."Nostromo laughed a little at the absurdity of the idea.  Theydismissed it from their minds. The solitude could almost be felt.And when the breeze ceased, the blackness seemed to weigh uponDecoud like a stone."This is overpowering," he muttered. "Do we move at all,Capataz?""Not so fast as a crawling beetle tangled in the grass," answeredNostromo, and his voice seemed deadened by the thick veil ofobscurity that felt warm and hopeless all about them. There werelong periods when he made no sound, invisible and inaudible as ifhe had mysteriously stepped out of the lighter.In the featureless night Nostromo was not even certain which waythe lighter headed after the wind had completely died out. Hepeered for the islands. There was not a hint of them to be seen,as if they had sunk to the bottom of the gulf. He threw himselfdown by the side of Decoud at last, and whispered into his earthat if daylight caught them near the Sulaco shore through wantof wind, it would be possible to sweep the lighter behind thecliff at the high end of the Great Isabel, where she would lieconcealed. Decoud was surprised at the grimness of his anxiety.To him the removal of the treasure was a political move. It wasnecessary for several reasons that it should not fall into thehands of Montero, but here was a man who took another view ofthis enterprise. The Caballeros over there did not seem to havethe slightest idea of what they had given him to do. Nostromo, asif affected by the gloom around, seemed nervously resentful.Decoud was surprised. The Capataz, indifferent to those dangersthat seemed obvious to his companion, allowed himself to becomescornfully exasperated by the deadly nature of the trust put, asa matter of course, into his hands.  It was more dangerous,Nostromo said, with a laugh and a curse, than sending a man toget the treasure that people said was guarded by devils andghosts in the deep ravines of Azuera. "Senor," he said, "we mustcatch the steamer at sea. We must keep out in the open lookingfor her till we have eaten and drunk all that has been put onboard here. And if we miss her by some mischance, we must keepaway from the land till we grow weak, and perhaps mad, and die,and drift dead, until one or another of the steamers of theCompania comes upon the boat with the two dead men who have savedthe treasure. That, senor, is the only way to save it; for, don'tyou see? for us to come to the land anywhere in a hundred milesalong this coast with this silver in our possession is to run thenaked breast against the point of a knife. This thing has beengiven to me like a deadly disease. If men discover it I am dead,and you, too, senor, since you would come with me. There isenough silver to make a whole province rich, let alone a seaboardpueblo inhabited by thieves and vagabonds. Senor, they wouldthink that heaven itself sent these riches into their hands, andwould cut our throats without hesitation. I would trust no fairwords from the best man around the shores of this wild gulf.Reflect that, even by giving up the treasure at the first demand,we would not be able to save our lives.  Do you understand this,or must I explain?""No, you needn't explain," said Decoud, a little listlessly. "Ican see it well enough myself, that the possession of thistreasure is very much like a deadly disease for men situated aswe are. But it had to be removed from Sulaco, and you were theman for the task.""I was; but I cannot believe," said Nostromo, "that its losswould have impoverished Don Carlos Gould very much. There is morewealth in the mountain. I have heard it rolling down the shootson quiet nights when I used to ride to Rincon to see a certaingirl, after my work at the harbour was done. For years the richrocks have been pouring down with a noise like thunder, and theminers say that there is enough at the heart of the mountain tothunder on for years and years to come. And yet, the day beforeyesterday, we have been fighting to save it from the mob, andto-night I am sent out with it into this darkness, where there isno wind to get away with; as if it were the last lot of silver onearth to get bread for the hungry with. Ha!  ha! Well, I am goingto make it the most famous and desperate affair of my life--windor no wind. It shall be talked about when the little children aregrown up and the grown men are old. Aha! the Monterists must notget hold of it, I am told, whatever happens to Nostromo theCapataz; and they shall not have it, I tell you, since it hasbeen tied for safety round Nostromo's neck.""I see it," murmured Decoud. He saw, indeed, that his companionhad his own peculiar view of this enterprise.Nostromo interrupted his reflections upon the way men's qualitiesare made use of, without any fundamental knowledge of theirnature, by the proposal they should slip the long oars out andsweep the lighter in the direction of the Isabels. It wouldn't dofor daylight to reveal the treasure floating within a mile or soof the harbour entrance. The denser the darkness generally, thesmarter were the puffs of wind on which he had reckoned to makehis way; but tonight the gulf, under its poncho of clouds,remained breathless, as if dead rather than asleep.Don Martin's soft hands suffered cruelly, tugging at the thickhandle of the enormous oar. He stuck to it manfully, setting histeeth. He, too, was in the toils of an imaginative existence, andthat strange work of pulling a lighter seemed to belong naturallyto the inception of a new state, acquired an ideal meaning fromhis love for Antonia. For all their efforts, the heavily ladenlighter hardly moved. Nostromo could be heard swearing to himselfbetween the regular splashes of the sweeps. "We are making acrooked path," he muttered to himself. "I wish I could see theislands."In his unskilfulness Don Martin over-exerted himself.  Now andthen a sort of muscular faintness would run from the tips of hisaching fingers through every fibre of his body, and pass off in aflush of heat. He had fought, talked, suffered mentally andphysically, exerting his mind and body for the last forty-eighthours without intermission. He had had no rest, very little food,no pause in the stress of his thoughts and his feelings. Even hislove for Antonia, whence he drew his strength and hisinspiration, had reached the point of tragic tension during theirhurried interview by Don Jose's bedside. And now, suddenly, hewas thrown out of all this into a dark gulf, whose very gloom,silence, and breathless peace added a torment to the necessityfor physical exertion. He imagined the lighter sinking to thebottom with an extraordinary shudder of delight. "I am on theverge of delirium," he thought. He mastered the trembling of allhis limbs, of his breast, the inward trembling of all his bodyexhausted of its nervous force."Shall we rest, Capataz?" he proposed in a careless tone. "Thereare many hours of night yet before us.""True. It is but a mile or so, I suppose. Rest your arms, senor,if that is what you mean. You will find no other sort of rest, Ican promise you, since you let yourself be bound to this treasurewhose loss would make no poor man poorer. No, senor; there is norest till we find a north-bound steamer, or else some ship findsus drifting about stretched out dead upon the Englishman'ssilver. Or rather--no; por Dios! I shall cut down the gunwalewith the axe right to the water's edge before thirst and hungerrob me of my strength.  By all the saints and devils I shall letthe sea have the treasure rather than give it up to any stranger.Since it was the good pleasure of the Caballeros to send me offon such an errand, they shall learn I am just the man they takeme for."Decoud lay on the silver boxes panting. All his active sensationsand feelings from as far back as he could remember seemed to himthe maddest of dreams.  Even his passionate devotion to Antoniainto which he had worked himself up out of the depths of hisscepticism had lost all appearance of reality. For a moment hewas the prey of an extremely languid but not unpleasantindifference."I am sure they didn't mean you to take such a desperate view ofthis affair," he said."What was it, then? A joke?" snarled the man, who on thepay-sheets of the O.S.N. Company's establishment in Sulaco wasdescribed as "Foreman of the wharf" against the figure of hiswages. "Was it for a joke they woke me up from my sleep after twodays of street fighting to make me stake my life upon a bad card?Everybody knows, too, that I am not a lucky gambler.""Yes, everybody knows of your good luck with women, Capataz,"Decoud propitiated his companion in a weary drawl."Look here, senor," Nostromo went on. "I never even remonstratedabout this affair. Directly I heard what was wanted I saw what adesperate affair it must be, and I made up my mind to see it out.Every minute was of importance. I had to wait for you first.Then, when we arrived at the Italia Una, old Giorgio shouted tome to go for the English doctor. Later on, that poor dying womanwanted to see me, as you know.  Senor, I was reluctant to go. Ifelt already this cursed silver growing heavy upon my back, and Iwas afraid that, knowing herself to be dying, she would ask me toride off again for a priest. Father Corbelan, who is fearless,would have come at a word; but Father Corbelan is far away, safewith the band of Hernandez, and the populace, that would haveliked to tear him to pieces, are much incensed against thepriests. Not a single fat padre would have consented to put hishead out of his hiding-place to-night to save a Christian soul,except, perhaps, under my protection.  That was in her mind. Ipretended I did not believe she was going to die. Senor, Irefused to fetch a priest for a dying woman . . ."Decoud was heard to stir."You did, Capataz!" he exclaimed. His tone changed. "Well, youknow--it was rather fine.""You do not believe in priests, Don Martin? Neither do I. Whatwas the use of wasting time? But she--she believes in them. Thething sticks in my throat.  She may be dead already, and here weare floating helpless with no wind at all. Curse on allsuperstition.  She died thinking I deprived her of Paradise, Isuppose.  It shall be the most desperate affair of my life."Decoud remained lost in reflection. He tried to analyze thesensations awaked by what he had been told. The voice of theCapataz was heard again:"Now, Don Martin, let us take up the sweeps and try to find theIsabels. It is either that or sinking the lighter if the dayovertakes us. We must not forget that the steamer from Esmeraldawith the soldiers may be coming along. We will pull straight onnow. I have discovered a bit of a candle here, and we must takethe risk of a small light to make a course by the boat compass.There is not enough wind to blow it out--may the curse of Heavenfall upon this blind gulf!"A small flame appeared burning quite straight. It showedfragmentarily the stout ribs and planking in the hollow, emptypart of the lighter. Decoud could see Nostromo standing up topull. He saw him as high as the red sash on his waist, with agleam of a white-handled revolver and the wooden haft of a longknife protruding on his left side. Decoud nerved himself for theeffort of rowing. Certainly there was not enough wind to blow thecandle out, but its flame swayed a little to the slow movement ofthe heavy boat. It was so big that with their utmost efforts theycould not move it quicker than about a mile an hour. This wassufficient, however, to sweep them amongst the Isabels longbefore daylight came. There was a good six hours of darknessbefore them, and the distance from the harbour to the GreatIsabel did not exceed two miles.  Decoud put this heavy toil tothe account of the Capataz's impatience. Sometimes they paused,and then strained their ears to hear the boat from Esmeralda.  Inthis perfect quietness a steamer moving would have been heardfrom far off. As to seeing anything it was out of the question.They could not see each other. Even the lighter's sail, whichremained set, was invisible. Very often they rested."Caramba!" said Nostromo, suddenly, during one of those intervalswhen they lolled idly against the heavy handles of the sweeps."What is it? Are you distressed, Don Martin?"Decoud assured him that he was not distressed in the least.Nostromo for a time kept perfectly still, and then in a whisperinvited Martin to come aft.With his lips touching Decoud's ear he declared his belief thatthere was somebody else besides themselves upon the lighter.Twice now he had heard the sound of stifled sobbing."Senor," he whispered with awed wonder, "I am certain that thereis somebody weeping in this lighter."Decoud had heard nothing. He expressed his incredulity.  However,it was easy to ascertain the truth of the matter."It is most amazing," muttered Nostromo. "Could anybody haveconcealed himself on board while the lighter was lying alongsidethe wharf?""And you say it was like sobbing?" asked Decoud, lowering hisvoice, too. "If he is weeping, whoever he is he cannot be verydangerous."Clambering over the precious pile in the middle, they crouchedlow on the foreside of the mast and groped under the half-deck.Right forward, in the narrowest part, their hands came upon thelimbs of a man, who remained as silent as death. Too startledthemselves to make a sound, they dragged him aft by one arm andthe collar of his coat. He was limp--lifeless.The light of the bit of candle fell upon a round, hook-nosed facewith black moustaches and little side-whiskers.  He was extremelydirty. A greasy growth of beard was sprouting on the shaven partsof the cheeks.  The thick lips were slightly parted, but the eyesremained closed. Decoud, to his immense astonishment, recognizedSenor Hirsch, the hide merchant from Esmeralda. Nostromo, too,had recognized him. And they gazed at each other across the body,lying with its naked feet higher than its head, in an absurdpretence of sleep, faintness, or death.CHAPTER EIGHTFOR a moment, before this extraordinary find, they forgot theirown concerns and sensations. Senor Hirsch's sensations as he laythere must have been those of extreme terror. For a long time herefused to give a sign of life, till at last Decoud'sobjurgations, and, perhaps more, Nostromo's impatient suggestionthat he should be thrown overboard, as he seemed to be dead,induced him to raise one eyelid first, and then the other.It appeared that he had never found a safe opportunity to leaveSulaco. He lodged with Anzani, the universal storekeeper, on thePlaza Mayor. But when the riot broke out he had made his escapefrom his host's house before daylight, and in such a hurry thathe had forgotten to put on his shoes. He had run out impulsivelyin his socks, and with his hat in his hand, into the garden ofAnzani's house. Fear gave him the necessary agility to climb overseveral low walls, and afterwards he blundered into the overgrowncloisters of the ruined Franciscan convent in one of theby-streets.  He forced himself into the midst of matted busheswith the recklessness of desperation, and this accounted for hisscratched body and his torn clothing. He lay hidden there allday, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth with all theintensity of thirst engendered by heat and fear. Three timesdifferent bands of men invaded the place with shouts andimprecations, looking for Father Corbelan; but towards theevening, still lying on his face in the bushes, he thought hewould die from the fear of silence. He was not very clear as towhat had induced him to leave the place, but evidently he had gotout and slunk successfully out of town along the deserted backlanes. He wandered in the darkness near the railway, so maddenedby apprehension that he dared not even approach the fires of thepickets of Italian workmen guarding the line. He had a vague ideaevidently of finding refuge in the railway yards, but the dogsrushed upon him, barking; men began to shout; a shot was fired atrandom. He fled away from the gates. By the merest accident, asit happened, he took the direction of the O.S.N. Company'soffices.  Twice he stumbled upon the bodies of men killed duringthe day. But everything living frightened him much more. Hecrouched, crept, crawled, made dashes, guided by a sort of animalinstinct, keeping away from every light and from every sound ofvoices. His idea was to throw himself at the feet of CaptainMitchell and beg for shelter in the Company's offices. It was alldark there as he approached on his hands and knees, but suddenlysomeone on guard challenged loudly, "Quien vive?" There were moredead men lying about, and he flattened himself down at once bythe side of a cold corpse. He heard a voice saying, "Here is oneof those wounded rascals crawling about. Shall I go and finishhim?" And another voice objected that it was not safe to go outwithout a lantern upon such an errand; perhaps it was only somenegro Liberal looking for a chance to stick a knife into thestomach of an honest man. Hirsch didn't stay to hear any more,but crawling away to the end of the wharf, hid himself amongst alot of empty casks. After a while some people came along,talking, and with glowing cigarettes.  He did not stop to askhimself whether they would be likely to do him any harm, butbolted incontinently along the jetty, saw a lighter lying mooredat the end, and threw himself into it. In his desire to findcover he crept right forward under the half-deck, and he hadremained there more dead than alive, suffering agonies of hungerand thirst, and almost fainting with terror, when he heardnumerous footsteps and the voices of the Europeans who came in abody escorting the wagonload of treasure, pushed along the railsby a squad of Cargadores. He understood perfectly what was beingdone from the talk, but did not disclose his presence from thefear that he would not be allowed to remain.  His only idea atthe time, overpowering and masterful, was to get away from thisterrible Sulaco. And now he regretted it very much. He had heardNostromo talk to Decoud, and wished himself back on shore.  Hedid not desire to be involved in any desperate affair--in asituation where one could not run away. The involuntary groans ofhis anguished spirit had betrayed him to the sharp ears of theCapataz.They had propped him up in a sitting posture against the side ofthe lighter, and he went on with the moaning account of hisadventures till his voice broke, his head fell forward. "Water,"he whispered, with difficulty.  Decoud held one of the cans tohis lips. He revived after an extraordinarily short time, andscrambled up to his feet wildly. Nostromo, in an angry andthreatening voice, ordered him forward. Hirsch was one of thosemen whom fear lashes like a whip, and he must have had anappalling idea of the Capataz's ferocity. He displayed anextraordinary agility in disappearing forward into the darkness.They heard him getting over the tarpaulin; then there was thesound of a heavy fall, followed by a weary sigh. Afterwards allwas still in the fore-part of the lighter, as though he hadkilled himself in his headlong tumble. Nostromo shouted in amenacing voice--"Lie still there! Do not move a limb. If I hear as much as a loudbreath from you I shall come over there and put a bullet throughyour head."The mere presence of a coward, however passive, brings an elementof treachery into a dangerous situation.  Nostromo's nervousimpatience passed into gloomy thoughtfulness. Decoud, in anundertone, as if speaking to himself, remarked that, after all,this bizarre event made no great difference. He could notconceive what harm the man could do. At most he would be in theway, like an inanimate and useless object--like a block of wood,for instance."I would think twice before getting rid of a piece of wood," saidNostromo, calmly. "Something may happen unexpectedly where youcould make use of it.  But in an affair like ours a man like thisought to be thrown overboard. Even if he were as brave as a lionwe would not want him here. We are not running away for ourlives. Senor, there is no harm in a brave man trying to savehimself with ingenuity and courage; but you have heard his tale,Don Martin. His being here is a miracle of fear--" Nostromopaused.  "There is no room for fear in this lighter," he addedthrough his teeth.Decoud had no answer to make. It was not a position for argument,for a display of scruples or feelings.  There were a thousandways in which a panic-stricken man could make himself dangerous.It was evident that Hirsch could not be spoken to, reasoned with,or persuaded into a rational line of conduct. The story of hisown escape demonstrated that clearly enough.  Decoud thought thatit was a thousand pities the wretch had not died of fright.Nature, who had made him what he was, seemed to have calculatedcruelly how much he could bear in the way of atrocious anguishwithout actually expiring. Some compassion was due to so muchterror. Decoud, though imaginative enough for sympathy, resolvednot to interfere with any action that Nostromo would take. ButNostromo did nothing.  And the fate of Senor Hirsch remainedsuspended in the darkness of the gulf at the mercy of eventswhich could not be foreseen.The Capataz, extending his hand, put out the candle suddenly. Itwas to Decoud as if his companion had destroyed, by a singletouch, the world of affairs, of loves, of revolution, where hiscomplacent superiority analyzed fearlessly all motives and allpassions, including his own.He gasped a little. Decoud was affected by the novelty of hisposition. Intellectually self-confident, he suffered from beingdeprived of the only weapon he could use with effect. Nointelligence could penetrate the darkness of the Placid Gulf.There remained only one thing he was certain of, and that was theoverweening vanity of his companion. It was direct,uncomplicated, naive, and effectual. Decoud, who had been makinguse of him, had tried to understand his man thoroughly. He haddiscovered a complete singleness of motive behind the variedmanifestations of a consistent character. This was why the manremained so astonishingly simple in the jealous greatness of hisconceit. And now there was a complication. It was evident that heresented having been given a task in which there were so manychances of failure. "I wonder," thought Decoud, "how he wouldbehave if I were not here."He heard Nostromo mutter again, "No! there is no room for fear onthis lighter. Courage itself does not seem good enough. I have agood eye and a steady hand; no man can say he ever saw me tiredor uncertain what to do; but por Dios, Don Martin, I have beensent out into this black calm on a business where neither a goodeye, nor a steady hand, nor judgment are any use. . . ." He sworea string of oaths in Spanish and Italian under his breath."Nothing but sheer desperation will do for this affair."These words were in strange contrast to the prevailing peace--tothis almost solid stillness of the gulf.  A shower fell with anabrupt whispering sound all round the boat, and Decoud took offhis hat, and, letting his head get wet, felt greatly refreshed.Presently a steady little draught of air caressed his cheek. Thelighter began to move, but the shower distanced it. The dropsceased to fall upon his head and hands, the whispering died outin the distance. Nostromo emitted a grunt of satisfaction, andgrasping the tiller, chirruped softly, as sailors do, toencourage the wind. Never for the last three days had Decoud feltless the need for what the Capataz would call desperation."I fancy I hear another shower on the water," he observed in atone of quiet content. "I hope it will catch us up."Nostromo ceased chirruping at once. "You hear another shower?" hesaid, doubtfully. A sort of thinning of the darkness seemed tohave taken place, and Decoud could see now the outline of hiscompanion's figure, and even the sail came out of the night likea square block of dense snow.The sound which Decoud had detected came along the water harshly.Nostromo recognized that noise partaking of a hiss and a rustlewhich spreads out on all sides of a steamer making her waythrough a smooth water on a quiet night. It could be nothing elsebut the captured transport with troops from Esmeralda.  Shecarried no lights. The noise of her steaming, growing louderevery minute, would stop at times altogether, and then beginagain abruptly, and sound startlingly nearer; as if thatinvisible vessel, whose position could not be precisely guessed,were making straight for the lighter. Meantime, that last kept onsailing slowly and noiselessly before a breeze so faint that itwas only by leaning over the side and feeling the water slipthrough his fingers that Decoud convinced himself they weremoving at all. His drowsy feeling had departed. He was glad toknow that the lighter was moving. After so much stillness thenoise of the steamer seemed uproarious and distracting. There wasa weirdness in not being able to see her. Suddenly all was still.She had stopped, but so close to them that the steam, blowingoff, sent its rumbling vibration right over their heads."They are trying to make out where they are," said Decoud in awhisper. Again he leaned over and put his fingers into the water."We are moving quite smartly," he informed Nostromo."We seem to be crossing her bows," said the Capataz in a cautioustone. "But this is a blind game with death. Moving on is of nouse. We mustn't be seen or heard."His whisper was hoarse with excitement. Of all his face there wasnothing visible but a gleam of white eyeballs.  His fingersgripped Decoud's shoulder. "That is the only way to save thistreasure from this steamer full of soldiers.  Any other wouldhave carried lights.  But you observe there is not a gleam toshow us where she is."Decoud stood as if paralyzed; only his thoughts were wildlyactive. In the space of a second he remembered the desolateglance of Antonia as he left her at the bedside of her father inthe gloomy house of Avellanos, with shuttered windows, but allthe doors standing open, and deserted by all the servants exceptan old negro at the gate. He remembered the Casa Gould on hislast visit, the arguments, the tones of his voice, theimpenetrable attitude of Charles, Mrs. Gould's face so blanchedwith anxiety and fatigue that her eyes seemed to have changedcolour, appearing nearly black by contrast.  Even whole sentencesof the proclamation which he meant to make Barrios issue from hisheadquarters at Cayta as soon as he got there passed through hismind; the very germ of the new State, the Separationistproclamation which he had tried before he left to read hurriedlyto Don Jose, stretched out on his bed under the fixed gaze of hisdaughter. God knows whether the old statesman had understood it;he was unable to speak, but he had certainly lifted his arm offthe coverlet; his hand had moved as if to make the sign of thecross in the air, a gesture of blessing, of consent. Decoud hadthat very draft in his pocket, written in pencil on several loosesheets of paper, with the heavily-printed heading,"Administration of the San Tome Silver Mine. Sulaco.  Republic ofCostaguana." He had written it furiously, snatching page afterpage on Charles Gould's table.  Mrs. Gould had looked severaltimes over his shoulder as he wrote; but the Senor Administrador,standing straddle-legged, would not even glance at it when it wasfinished. He had waved it away firmly. It must have been scorn,and not caution, since he never made a remark about the use ofthe Administration's paper for such a compromising document. Andthat showed his disdain, the true English disdain of commonprudence, as if everything outside the range of their ownthoughts and feelings were unworthy of serious recognition.Decoud had the time in a second or two to become furiously angrywith Charles Gould, and even resentful against Mrs. Gould, inwhose care, tacitly it is true, he had left the safety ofAntonia. Better perish a thousand times than owe yourpreservation to such people, he exclaimed mentally. The grip ofNostromo's fingers never removed from his shoulder, tighteningfiercely, recalled him to himself."The darkness is our friend," the Capataz murmured into his ear."I am going to lower the sail, and trust our escape to this blackgulf. No eyes could make us out lying silent with a naked mast. Iwill do it now, before this steamer closes still more upon us.The faint creak of a block would betray us and the San Tometreasure into the hands of those thieves."He moved about as warily as a cat. Decoud heard no sound; and itwas only by the disappearance of the square blotch of darknessthat he knew the yard had come down, lowered as carefully as ifit had been made of glass. Next moment he heard Nostromo's quietbreathing by his side."You had better not move at all from where you are, Don Martin,"advised the Capataz, earnestly. "You might stumble or displacesomething which would make a noise. The sweeps and the puntingpoles are lying about. Move not for your life. Por Dios, DonMartin," he went on in a keen but friendly whisper, "I am sodesperate that if I didn't know your worship to be a man ofcourage, capable of standing stock still whatever happens, Iwould drive my knife into your heart."A deathlike stillness surrounded the lighter. It was difficult tobelieve that there was near a steamer full of men with many pairsof eyes peering from her bridge for some hint of land in thenight. Her steam had ceased blowing off, and she remained stoppedtoo far off apparently for any other sound to reach the lighter."Perhaps you would, Capataz," Decoud began in a whisper."However, you need not trouble. There are other things than thefear of your knife to keep my heart steady. It shall not betrayyou. Only, have you forgotten--""I spoke to you openly as to a man as desperate as myself,"explained the Capataz. "The silver must be saved from theMonterists. I told Captain Mitchell three times that I preferredto go alone. I told Don Carlos Gould, too. It was in the CasaGould. They had sent for me. The ladies were there; and when Itried to explain why I did not wish to have you with me, theypromised me, both of them, great rewards for your safety. Astrange way to talk to a man you are sending out to an almostcertain death. Those gentlefolk do not seem to have sense enoughto understand what they are giving one to do. I told them I coulddo nothing for you. You would have been safer with the banditHernandez. It would have been possible to ride out of the townwith no greater risk than a chance shot sent after you in thedark. But it was as if they had been deaf. I had to promise Iwould wait for you under the harbour gate. I did wait. And nowbecause you are a brave man you are as safe as the silver.Neither more nor less."At that moment, as if by way of comment upon Nostromo's words,the invisible steamer went ahead at half speed only, as could bejudged by the leisurely beat of her propeller. The sound shiftedits place markedly, but without coming nearer. It even grew alittle more distant right abeam of the lighter, and then ceasedagain."They are trying for a sight of the Isabels," muttered Nostromo,"in order to make for the harbour in a straight line and seizethe Custom House with the treasure in it. Have you ever seen theCommandant of Esmeralda, Sotillo? A handsome fellow, with a softvoice. When I first came here I used to see him in the Calletalking to the senoritas at the windows of the houses, andshowing his white teeth all the time. But one of my Cargadores,who had been a soldier, told me that he had once ordered a man tobe flayed alive in the remote Campo, where he was sent recruitingamongst the people of the Estancias. It has never entered hishead that the Compania had a man capable of baffling his game."The murmuring loquacity of the Capataz disturbed Decoud like ahint of weakness. And yet, talkative resolution may be as genuineas grim silence."Sotillo is not baffled so far," he said. "Have you forgottenthat crazy man forward?"Nostromo had not forgotten Senor Hirsch. He reproached himselfbitterly for not having visited the lighter carefully beforeleaving the wharf. He reproached himself for not having stabbedand flung Hirsch overboard at the very moment of discoverywithout even looking at his face. That would have been consistentwith the desperate character of the affair.  Whatever happened,Sotillo was already baffled. Even if that wretch, now as silentas death, did anything to betray the nearness of the lighter,Sotillo--if Sotillo it was in command of the troops onboard--would be still baffled of his plunder."I have an axe in my hand," Nostromo whispered, wrathfully, "thatin three strokes would cut through the side down to the water'sedge. Moreover, each lighter has a plug in the stern, and I knowexactly where it is. I feel it under the sole of my foot."Decoud recognized the ring of genuine determination in thenervous murmurs, the vindictive excitement of the famous Capataz.Before the steamer, guided by a shriek or two (for there could beno more than that, Nostromo said, gnashing his teeth audibly),could find the lighter there would be plenty of time to sink thistreasure tied up round his neck.The last words he hissed into Decoud's ear. Decoud said nothing.He was perfectly convinced.  The usual characteristic quietnessof the man was gone.  It was not equal to the situation as heconceived it.  Something deeper, something unsuspected byeveryone, had come to the surface. Decoud, with carefulmovements, slipped off his overcoat and divested himself of hisboots; he did not consider himself bound in honour to sink withthe treasure. His object was to get down to Barrios, in Cayta, asthe Capataz knew very well; and he, too, meant, in his own way,to put into that attempt all the desperation of which he wascapable. Nostromo muttered, "True, true! You are a politician,senor.  Rejoin the army, and start another revolution." Hepointed out, however, that there was a little boat belonging toevery lighter fit to carry two men, if not more.  Theirs wastowing behind.Of that Decoud had not been aware. Of course, it was too dark tosee, and it was only when Nostromo put his hand upon its painterfastened to a cleat in the stern that he experienced a fullmeasure of relief. The prospect of finding himself in the waterand swimming, overwhelmed by ignorance and darkness, probably ina circle, till he sank from exhaustion, was revolting. The barrenand cruel futility of such an end intimidated his affectation ofcareless pessimism. In comparison to it, the chance of being leftfloating in a boat, exposed to thirst, hunger, discovery,imprisonment, execution, presented itself with an aspect ofamenity worth securing even at the cost of some self-contempt. Hedid not accept Nostromo's proposal that he should get into theboat at once. "Something sudden may overwhelm us, senor," theCapataz remarked promising faithfully, at the same time, to letgo the painter at the moment when the necessity became manifest.But Decoud assured him lightly that he did not mean to take tothe boat till the very last moment, and that then he meant theCapataz to come along, too. The darkness of the gulf was nolonger for him the end of all things. It was part of a livingworld since, pervading it, failure and death could be felt atyour elbow. And at the same time it was a shelter. He exulted inits impenetrable obscurity. "Like a wall, like a wall," hemuttered to himself.The only thing which checked his confidence was the thought ofSenor Hirsch. Not to have bound and gagged him seemed to Decoudnow the height of improvident folly. As long as the miserablecreature had the power to raise a yell he was a constant danger.His abject terror was mute now, but there was no saying from whatcause it might suddenly find vent in shrieks.This very madness of fear which both Decoud and Nostromo had seenin the wild and irrational glances, and in the continuoustwitchings of his mouth, protected Senor Hirsch from the cruelnecessities of this desperate affair. The moment of silencing himfor ever had passed. As Nostromo remarked, in answer to Decoud'sregrets, it was too late! It could not be done without noise,especially in the ignorance of the man's exact position. Whereverhe had elected to crouch and tremble, it was too hazardous to gonear him. He would begin probably to yell for mercy. It was muchbetter to leave him quite alone since he was keeping so still.But to trust to his silence became every moment a greater strainupon Decoud's composure."I wish, Capataz, you had not let the right moment pass," hemurmured."What! To silence him for ever? I thought it good to hear firsthow he came to be here. It was too strange. Who could imaginethat it was all an accident?  Afterwards, senor, when I saw yougiving him water to drink, I could not do it. Not after I hadseen you holding up the can to his lips as though he were yourbrother. Senor, that sort of necessity must not be thought of toolong. And yet it would have been no cruelty to take away from himhis wretched life. It is nothing but fear. Your compassion savedhim then, Don Martin, and now it is too late. It couldn't be donewithout noise."In the steamer they were keeping a perfect silence, and thestillness was so profound that Decoud felt as if the slightestsound conceivable must travel unchecked and audible to the end ofthe world. What if Hirsch coughed or sneezed? To feel himself atthe mercy of such an idiotic contingency was too exasperating tobe looked upon with irony. Nostromo, too, seemed to be gettingrestless. Was it possible, he asked himself, that the steamer,finding the night too dark altogether, intended to remain stoppedwhere she was till daylight?  He began to think that this, afterall, was the real danger.  He was afraid that the darkness, whichwas his protection, would, in the end, cause his undoing.Sotillo, as Nostromo had surmised, was in command on board thetransport. The events of the last forty-eight hours in Sulacowere not known to him; neither was he aware that the telegraphistin Esmeralda had managed to warn his colleague in Sulaco. Like agood many officers of the troops garrisoning the province,Sotillo had been influenced in his adoption of the Ribieristcause by the belief that it had the enormous wealth of the GouldConcession on its side. He had been one of the frequenters of theCasa Gould, where he had aired his Blanco convictions and hisardour for reform before Don Jose Avellanos, casting frank,honest glances towards Mrs. Gould and Antonia the while. He wasknown to belong to a good family persecuted and impoverishedduring the tyranny of Guzman Bento.  The opinions he expressedappeared eminently natural and proper in a man of his parentageand antecedents.  And he was not a deceiver; it was perfectlynatural for him to express elevated sentiments while his wholefaculties were taken up with what seemed then a solid andpractical notion--the notion that the husband of AntoniaAvellanos would be, naturally, the intimate friend of the GouldConcession. He even pointed this out to Anzani once, whennegotiating the sixth or seventh small loan in the gloomy, dampapartment with enormous iron bars, behind the principal shop inthe whole row under the Arcades. He hinted to the universalshopkeeper at the excellent terms he was on with the emancipatedsenorita, who was like a sister to the Englishwoman. He wouldadvance one leg and put his arms akimbo, posing for Anzani'sinspection, and fixing him with a haughty stare."Look, miserable shopkeeper! How can a man like me fail with anywoman, let alone an emancipated girl living in scandalousfreedom?" he seemed to say.His manner in the Casa Gould was, of course, verydifferent--devoid of all truculence, and even slightly mournful.Like most of his countrymen, he was carried away by the sound offine words, especially if uttered by himself. He had noconvictions of any sort upon anything except as to theirresistible power of his personal advantages. But that was sofirm that even Decoud's appearance in Sulaco, and his intimacywith the Goulds and the Avellanos, did not disquiet him.  On thecontrary, he tried to make friends with that rich Costaguanerofrom Europe in the hope of borrowing a large sum by-and-by. Theonly guiding motive of his life was to get money for thesatisfaction of his expensive tastes, which he indulgedrecklessly, having no self-control.  He imagined himself a masterof intrigue, but his corruption was as simple as an animalinstinct. At times, in solitude, he had his moments of ferocity,and also on such occasions as, for instance, when alone in a roomwith Anzani trying to get a loan.He had talked himself into the command of the Esmeralda garrison.That small seaport had its importance as the station of the mainsubmarine cable connecting the Occidental Provinces with theouter world, and the junction with it of the Sulaco branch. DonJose Avellanos proposed him, and Barrios, with a rude and jeeringguffaw, had said, "Oh, let Sotillo go. He is a very good man tokeep guard over the cable, and the ladies of Esmeralda ought tohave their turn." Barrios, an indubitably brave man, had no greatopinion of Sotillo.It was through the Esmeralda cable alone that the San Tome minecould be kept in constant touch with the great financier, whosetacit approval made the strength of the Ribierist movement. Thismovement had its adversaries even there. Sotillo governedEsmeralda with repressive severity till the adverse course ofevents upon the distant theatre of civil war forced upon him thereflection that, after all, the great silver mine was fated tobecome the spoil of the victors.  But caution was necessary. Hebegan by assuming a dark and mysterious attitude towards thefaithful Ribierist municipality of Esmeralda. Later on, theinformation that the commandant was holding assemblies ofofficers in the dead of night (which had leaked out somehow)caused those gentlemen to neglect their civil duties altogether,and remain shut up in their houses. Suddenly one day all theletters from Sulaco by the overland courier were carried off by afile of soldiers from the post office to the Commandancia,without disguise, concealment, or apology. Sotillo had heardthrough Cayta of the final defeat of Ribiera.This was the first open sign of the change in his convictions.Presently notorious democrats, who had been living till then inconstant fear of arrest, leg irons, and even floggings, could beobserved going in and out at the great door of the Commandancia,where the horses of the orderlies doze under their heavy saddles,while the men, in ragged uniforms and pointed straw hats, loungeon a bench, with their naked feet stuck out beyond the strip ofshade; and a sentry, in a red baize coat with holes at theelbows, stands at the top of the steps glaring haughtily at thecommon people, who uncover their heads to him as they pass.Sotillo's ideas did not soar above the care for his personalsafety and the chance of plundering the town in his charge, buthe feared that such a late adhesion would earn but scantgratitude from the victors. He had believed just a little toolong in the power of the San Tome mine. The seized correspondencehad confirmed his previous information of a large amount ofsilver ingots lying in the Sulaco Custom House. To gainpossession of it would be a clear Monterist move; a sort ofservice that would have to be rewarded. With the silver in hishands he could make terms for himself and his soldiers. He wasaware neither of the riots, nor of the President's escape toSulaco and the close pursuit led by Montero's brother, theguerrillero. The game seemed in his own hands. The initial moveswere the seizure of the cable telegraph office and the securingof the Government steamer lying in the narrow creek which is theharbour of Esmeralda. The last was effected without difficulty bya company of soldiers swarming with a rush over the gangways asshe lay alongside the quay; but the lieutenant charged with theduty of arresting the telegraphist halted on the way before theonly cafe in Esmeralda, where he distributed some brandy to hismen, and refreshed himself at the expense of the owner, a knownRibierist. The whole party became intoxicated, and proceeded ontheir mission up the street yelling and firing random shots atthe windows. This little festivity, which might have turned outdangerous to the telegraphist's life, enabled him in the end tosend his warning to Sulaco. The lieutenant, staggering upstairswith a drawn sabre, was before long kissing him on both cheeks inone of those swift changes of mood peculiar to a state ofdrunkenness.  He clasped the telegraphist close round the neck,assuring him that all the officers of the Esmeralda garrison weregoing to be made colonels, while tears of happiness streamed downhis sodden face. Thus it came about that the town major, comingalong later, found the whole party sleeping on the stairs and inpassages, and the telegraphist (who scorned this chance ofescape) very busy clicking the key of the transmitter.  The majorled him away bareheaded, with his hands tied behind his back, butconcealed the truth from Sotillo, who remained in ignorance ofthe warning despatched to Sulaco.The colonel was not the man to let any sort of darkness stand inthe way of the planned surprise. It appeared to him a deadcertainty; his heart was set upon his object with anungovernable, childlike impatience.  Ever since the steamer hadrounded Punta Mala, to enter the deeper shadow of the gulf, hehad remained on the bridge in a group of officers as excited ashimself.  Distracted between the coaxings and menaces of Sotilloand his Staff, the miserable commander of the steamer kept hermoving with as much prudence as they would let him exercise. Someof them had been drinking heavily, no doubt; but the prospect oflaying hands on so much wealth made them absurdly foolhardy, and,at the same time, extremely anxious. The old major of thebattalion, a stupid, suspicious man, who had never been afloat inhis life, distinguished himself by putting out suddenly thebinnacle light, the only one allowed on board for the necessitiesof navigation. He could not understand of what use it could befor finding the way. To the vehement protestations of the ship'scaptain, he stamped his foot and tapped the handle of his sword."Aha! I have unmasked you," he cried, triumphantly. "You aretearing your hair from despair at my acuteness. Am I a child tobelieve that a light in that brass box can show you where theharbour is? I am an old soldier, I am. I can smell a traitor aleague off. You wanted that gleam to betray our approach to yourfriend the Englishman. A thing like that show you the way! What amiserable lie!  Que picardia! You Sulaco people are all in thepay of those foreigners. You deserve to be run through the bodywith my sword." Other officers, crowding round, tried to calm hisindignation, repeating persuasively, "No, no! This is anappliance of the mariners, major.  This is no treachery." Thecaptain of the transport flung himself face downwards on thebridge, and refused to rise. "Put an end to me at once," herepeated in a stifled voice. Sotillo had to interfere.The uproar and confusion on the bridge became so great that thehelmsman fled from the wheel. He took refuge in the engine-room,and alarmed the engineers, who, disregarding the threats of thesoldiers set on guard over them, stopped the engines, protestingthat they would rather be shot than run the risk of being drowneddown below.This was the first time Nostromo and Decoud heard the steamerstop. After order had been restored, and the binnacle lamprelighted, she went ahead again, passing wide of the lighter inher search for the Isabels. The group could not be made out, and,at the pitiful entreaties of the captain, Sotillo allowed theengines to be stopped again to wait for one of those periodicallightenings of darkness caused by the shifting of the cloudcanopy spread above the waters of the gulf.Sotillo, on the bridge, muttered from time to time angrily to thecaptain. The other, in an apologetic and cringing tone, begged sumerced the colonel to take into consideration the limitations putupon human faculties by the darkness of the night. Sotilloswelled with rage and impatience. It was the chance of alifetime."If your eyes are of no more use to you than this, I shall havethem put out," he yelled.The captain of the steamer made no answer, for just then the massof the Great Isabel loomed up darkly after a passing shower, thenvanished, as if swept away by a wave of greater obscuritypreceding another downpour.  This was enough for him. In thevoice of a man come back to life again, he informed Sotillo thatin an hour he would be alongside the Sulaco wharf. The ship wasput then full speed on the course, and a great bustle ofpreparation for landing arose among the soldiers on her deck.It was heard distinctly by Decoud and Nostromo.  The Capatazunderstood its meaning. They had made out the Isabels, and weregoing on now in a straight line for Sulaco. He judged that theywould pass close; but believed that lying still like this, withthe sail lowered, the lighter could not be seen. "No, not even ifthey rubbed sides with us," he muttered.The rain began to fall again; first like a wet mist, then with aheavier touch, thickening into a smart, perpendicular downpour;and the hiss and thump of the approaching steamer was comingextremely near. Decoud, with his eyes full of water, and loweredhead, asked himself how long it would be before she drew past,when unexpectedly he felt a lurch. An inrush of foam brokeswishing over the stern, simultaneously with a crack of timbersand a staggering shock. He had the impression of an angry handlaying hold of the lighter and dragging it along to destruction.The shock, of course, had knocked him down, and he found himselfrolling in a lot of water at the bottom of the lighter. A violentchurning went on alongside; a strange and amazed voice cried outsomething above him in the night. He heard a piercing shriek forhelp from Senor Hirsch. He kept his teeth hard set all the time.It was a collision!The steamer had struck the lighter obliquely, heeling her overtill she was half swamped, starting some of her timbers, andswinging her head parallel to her own course with the force ofthe blow. The shock of it on board of her was hardly perceptible.All the violence of that collision was, as usual, felt only onboard the smaller craft. Even Nostromo himself thought that thiswas perhaps the end of his desperate adventure.  He, too, hadbeen flung away from the long tiller, which took charge in thelurch. Next moment the steamer would have passed on, leaving thelighter to sink or swim after having shouldered her thus out ofher way, and without even getting a glimpse of her form, had itnot been that, being deeply laden with stores and the greatnumber of people on board, her anchor was low enough to hookitself into one of the wire shrouds of the lighter's mast. Forthe space of two or three gasping breaths that new rope heldagainst the sudden strain.  It was this that gave Decoud thesensation of the snatching pull, dragging the lighter away todestruction.  The cause of it, of course, was inexplicable tohim. The whole thing was so sudden that he had no time to think.But all his sensations were perfectly clear; he had kept completepossession of himself; in fact, he was even pleasantly aware ofthat calmness at the very moment of being pitched head first overthe transom, to struggle on his back in a lot of water. SenorHirsch's shriek he had heard and recognized while he wasregaining his feet, always with that mysterious sensation ofbeing dragged headlong through the darkness. Not a word, not acry escaped him; he had no time to see anything; and followingupon the despairing screams for help, the dragging motion ceasedso suddenly that he staggered forward with open arms and fellagainst the pile of the treasure boxes. He clung to theminstinctively, in the vague apprehension of being flung aboutagain; and immediately he heard another lot of shrieks for help,prolonged and despairing, not near him at all, but unaccountablyin the distance, away from the lighter altogether, as if somespirit in the night were mocking at Senor Hirsch's terror anddespair.Then all was still--as still as when you wake up in your bed in adark room from a bizarre and agitated dream. The lighter rockedslightly; the rain was still falling. Two groping hands took holdof his bruised sides from behind, and the Capataz's voicewhispered, in his ear, "Silence, for your life! Silence! Thesteamer has stopped."Decoud listened. The gulf was dumb. He felt the water nearly upto his knees. "Are we sinking?" he asked in a faint breath."I don't know," Nostromo breathed back to him.  "Senor, make notthe slightest sound."Hirsch, when ordered forward by Nostromo, had not returned intohis first hiding-place. He had fallen near the mast, and had nostrength to rise; moreover, he feared to move. He had givenhimself up for dead, but not on any rational grounds. It wassimply a cruel and terrifying feeling. Whenever he tried to thinkwhat would become of him his teeth would start chatteringviolently. He was too absorbed in the utter misery of his fear totake notice of anything.Though he was stifling under the lighter's sail which Nostromohad unwittingly lowered on top of him, he did not even dare toput out his head till the very moment of the steamer striking.Then, indeed, he leaped right out, spurred on to new miracles ofbodily vigour by this new shape of danger. The inrush of waterwhen the lighter heeled over unsealed his lips.  His shriek,"Save me!" was the first distinct warning of the collision forthe people on board the steamer. Next moment the wire shroudparted, and the released anchor swept over the lighter'sforecastle. It came against the breast of Senor Hirsch, whosimply seized hold of it, without in the least knowing what itwas, but curling his arms and legs upon the part above the flukewith an invincible, unreasonable tenacity. The lighter yawed offwide, and the steamer, moving on, carried him away, clinginghard, and shouting for help. It was some time, however, after thesteamer had stopped that his position was discovered. Hissustained yelping for help seemed to come from somebody swimmingin the water. At last a couple of men went over the bows andhauled him on board. He was carried straight off to Sotillo onthe bridge. His examination confirmed the impression that somecraft had been run over and sunk, but it was impracticable onsuch a dark night to look for the positive proof of floatingwreckage. Sotillo was more anxious than ever now to enter theharbour without loss of time; the idea that he had destroyed theprincipal object of his expedition was too intolerable to beaccepted. This feeling made the story he had heard appear themore incredible. Senor Hirsch, after being beaten a little fortelling lies, was thrust into the chartroom.  But he was beatenonly a little. His tale had taken the heart out of Sotillo'sStaff, though they all repeated round their chief, "Impossible!impossible!" with the exception of the old major, who triumphedgloomily."I told you; I told you," he mumbled. "I could smell sometreachery, some diableria a league off."Meantime, the steamer had kept on her way towards Sulaco, whereonly the truth of that matter could be ascertained. Decoud andNostromo heard the loud churning of her propeller diminish anddie out; and then, with no useless words, busied themselves inmaking for the Isabels. The last shower had brought with it agentle but steady breeze. The danger was not over yet, and therewas no time for talk. The lighter was leaking like a sieve. Theysplashed in the water at every step. The Capataz put intoDecoud's hands the handle of the pump which was fitted at theside aft, and at once, without question or remark, Decoud beganto pump in utter forgetfulness of every desire but that ofkeeping the treasure afloat. Nostromo hoisted the sail, flew backto the tiller, pulled at the sheet like mad. The short flare of amatch (they had been kept dry in a tight tin box, though the manhimself was completely wet), disclosed to the toiling Decoud theeagerness of his face, bent low over the box of the compass, andthe attentive stare of his eyes. He knew now where he was, and hehoped to run the sinking lighter ashore in the shallow cove wherethe high, cliff-like end of the Great Isabel is divided in twoequal parts by a deep and overgrown ravine.Decoud pumped without intermission. Nostromo steered withoutrelaxing for a second the intense, peering effort of his stare.Each of them was as if utterly alone with his task. It did notoccur to them to speak.  There was nothing in common between thembut the knowledge that the damaged lighter must be slowly butsurely sinking. In that knowledge, which was like the crucialtest of their desires, they seemed to have become completelyestranged, as if they had discovered in the very shock of thecollision that the loss of the lighter would not mean the samething to them both.  This common danger brought their differencesin aim, in view, in character, and in position, into absoluteprominence in the private vision of each. There was no bond ofconviction, of common idea; they were merely two adventurerspursuing each his own adventure, involved in the same imminenceof deadly peril. Therefore they had nothing to say to each other.But this peril, this only incontrovertible truth in which theyshared, seemed to act as an inspiration to their mental andbodily powers.There was certainly something almost miraculous in the way theCapataz made the cove with nothing but the shadowy hint of theisland's shape and the vague gleam of a small sandy strip for aguide. Where the ravine opens between the cliffs, and a slender,shallow rivulet meanders out of the bushes to lose itself in thesea, the lighter was run ashore; and the two men, with ataciturn, undaunted energy, began to discharge her preciousfreight, carrying each ox-hide box up the bed of the rivuletbeyond the bushes to a hollow place which the caving in of thesoil had made below the roots of a large tree. Its big smoothtrunk leaned like a falling column far over the trickle of waterrunning amongst the loose stones.A couple of years before Nostromo had spent a whole Sunday, allalone, exploring the island. He explained this to Decoud aftertheir task was done, and they sat, weary in every limb, withtheir legs hanging down the low bank, and their backs against thetree, like a pair of blind men aware of each other and theirsurroundings by some indefinable sixth sense."Yes," Nostromo repeated, "I never forget a place I havecarefully looked at once." He spoke slowly, almost lazily, as ifthere had been a whole leisurely life before him, instead of thescanty two hours before daylight.  The existence of the treasure,barely concealed in this improbable spot, laid a burden ofsecrecy upon every contemplated step, upon every intention andplan of future conduct. He felt the partial failure of thisdesperate affair entrusted to the great reputation he had knownhow to make for himself. However, it was also a partial success.His vanity was half appeased. His nervous irritation hadsubsided."You never know what may be of use," he pursued with his usualquietness of tone and manner. "I spent a whole miserable Sundayin exploring this crumb of land.""A misanthropic sort of occupation," muttered Decoud, viciously."You had no money, I suppose, to gamble with, and to fling aboutamongst the girls in your usual haunts, Capataz.""e vero!" exclaimed the Capataz, surprised into the use of hisnative tongue by so much perspicacity. "I had not! Therefore Idid not want to go amongst those beggarly people accustomed to mygenerosity. It is looked for from the Capataz of the Cargadores,who are the rich men, and, as it were, the Caballeros amongst thecommon people. I don't care for cards but as a pastime; and as tothose girls that boast of having opened their doors to my knock,you know I wouldn't look at any one of them twice except for whatthe people would say. They are queer, the good people of Sulaco,and I have got much useful information simply by listeningpatiently to the talk of the women that everybody believed I wasin love with. Poor Teresa could never understand that. On thatparticular Sunday, senor, she scolded so that I went out of thehouse swearing that I would never darken their door again unlessto fetch away my hammock and my chest of clothes.  Senor, thereis nothing more exasperating than to hear a woman you respectrail against your good reputation when you have not a singlebrass coin in your pocket.  I untied one of the small boats andpulled myself out of the harbour with nothing but three cigars inmy pocket to help me spend the day on this island. But the waterof this rivulet you hear under your feet is cool and sweet andgood, senor, both before and after a smoke." He was silent for awhile, then added reflectively, "That was the first Sunday afterI brought down the white-whiskered English rico all the way downthe mountains from the Paramo on the top of the Entrada Pass--andin the coach, too! No coach had gone up or down that mountainroad within the memory of man, senor, till I brought this onedown in charge of fifty peons working like one man with ropes,pickaxes, and poles under my direction. That was the richEnglishman who, as people say, pays for the making of thisrailway. He was very pleased with me. But my wages were not duetill the end of the month."He slid down the bank suddenly. Decoud heard the splash of hisfeet in the brook and followed his footsteps down the ravine. Hisform was lost among the bushes till he had reached the strip ofsand under the cliff.  As often happens in the gulf when theshowers during the first part of the night had been frequent andheavy, the darkness had thinned considerably towards the morningthough there were no signs of daylight as yet.The cargo-lighter, relieved of its precious burden, rockedfeebly, half-afloat, with her fore-foot on the sand.  A long ropestretched away like a black cotton thread across the strip ofwhite beach to the grapnel Nostromo had carried ashore and hookedto the stem of a tree-like shrub in the very opening of theravine.There was nothing for Decoud but to remain on the island. Hereceived from Nostromo's hands whatever food the foresight ofCaptain Mitchell had put on board the lighter and deposited ittemporarily in the little dinghy which on their arrival they hadhauled up out of sight amongst the bushes. It was to be left withhim. The island was to be a hiding-place, not a prison; he couldpull out to a passing ship. The O.S.N. Company's mail boatspassed close to the islands when going into Sulaco from thenorth. But the Minerva, carrying off the ex-president, had takenthe news up north of the disturbances in Sulaco. It was possiblethat the next steamer down would get instructions to miss theport altogether since the town, as far as the Minerva's officersknew, was for the time being in the hands of the rabble. Thiswould mean that there would be no steamer for a month, as far asthe mail service went; but Decoud had to take his chance of that.The island was his only shelter from the proscription hangingover his head. The Capataz was, of course, going back. Theunloaded lighter leaked much less, and he thought that she wouldkeep afloat as far as the harbour.He passed to Decoud, standing knee-deep alongside, one of the twospades which belonged to the equipment of each lighter for usewhen ballasting ships. By working with it carefully as soon asthere was daylight enough to see, Decoud could loosen a mass ofearth and stones overhanging the cavity in which they haddeposited the treasure, so that it would look as if it had fallennaturally. It would cover up not only the cavity, but even alltraces of their work, the footsteps, the displaced stones, andeven the broken bushes."Besides, who would think of looking either for you or thetreasure here?" Nostromo continued, as if he could not tearhimself away from the spot. "Nobody is ever likely to come here.What could any man want with this piece of earth as long as thereis room for his feet on the mainland! The people in this countryare not curious. There are even no fishermen here to intrude uponyour worship. All the fishing that is done in the gulf goes onnear Zapiga, over there. Senor, if you are forced to leave thisisland before anything can be arranged for you, do not try tomake for Zapiga. It is a settlement of thieves and matreros,where they would cut your throat promptly for the sake of yourgold watch and chain. And, senor, think twice before confiding inany one whatever; even in the officers of the Company's steamers,if you ever get on board one.  Honesty alone is not enough forsecurity. You must look to discretion and prudence in a man. Andalways remember, senor, before you open your lips for aconfidence, that this treasure may be left safely here forhundreds of years. Time is on its side, senor. And silver is anincorruptible metal that can be trusted to keep its value forever. . . . An incorruptible metal," he repeated, as if the ideahad given him a profound pleasure."As some men are said to be," Decoud pronounced, inscrutably,while the Capataz, who busied himself in baling out the lighterwith a wooden bucket, went on throwing the water over the sidewith a regular splash.  Decoud, incorrigible in his scepticism,reflected, not cynically, but with general satisfaction, thatthis man was made incorruptible by his enormous vanity, thatfinest form of egoism which can take on the aspect of everyvirtue.Nostromo ceased baling, and, as if struck with a sudden thought,dropped the bucket with a clatter into the lighter."Have you any message?" he asked in a lowered voice. "Remember, Ishall be asked questions.""You must find the hopeful words that ought to be spoken to thepeople in town. I trust for that your intelligence and yourexperience, Capataz. You understand?""Si, senor. . . . For the ladies.""Yes, yes," said Decoud, hastily. "Your wonderful reputation willmake them attach great value to your words; therefore be carefulwhat you say. I am looking forward," he continued, feeling thefatal touch of contempt for himself to which his complex naturewas subject, "I am looking forward to a glorious and successfulending to my mission. Do you hear, Capataz?  Use the wordsglorious and successful when you speak to the senorita. Your ownmission is accomplished gloriously and successfully. You haveindubitably saved the silver of the mine. Not only this silver,but probably all the silver that shall ever come out of it."Nostromo detected the ironic tone. "I dare say, Senor DonMartin," he said, moodily. "There are very few things that I amnot equal to. Ask the foreign signori. I, a man of the people,who cannot always understand what you mean.   But as to this lotwhich I must leave here, let me tell you that I would believe itin greater safety if you had not been with me at all."An exclamation escaped Decoud, and a short pause followed. "ShallI go back with you to Sulaco?" he asked in an angry tone."Shall I strike you dead with my knife where you stand?" retortedNostromo, contemptuously. "It would be the same thing as takingyou to Sulaco.  Come, senor. Your reputation is in your politics,and mine is bound up with the fate of this silver. Do you wonderI wish there had been no other man to share my knowledge? Iwanted no one with me, senor.""You could not have kept the lighter afloat without me," Decoudalmost shouted. "You would have gone to the bottom with her.""Yes," uttered Nostromo, slowly; "alone."Here was a man, Decoud reflected, that seemed as though he wouldhave preferred to die rather than deface the perfect form of hisegoism. Such a man was safe. In silence he helped the Capataz toget the grapnel on board.   Nostromo cleared the shelving shorewith one push of the heavy oar, and Decoud found himself solitaryon the beach like a man in a dream. A sudden desire to hear ahuman voice once more seized upon his heart. The lighter washardly distinguishable from the black water upon which shefloated."What do you think has become of Hirsch?" he shouted."Knocked overboard and drowned," cried Nostromo's voiceconfidently out of the black wastes of sky and sea around theislet. "Keep close in the ravine, senor. I shall try to come outto you in a night or two."A slight swishing rustle showed that Nostromo was setting thesail. It filled all at once with a sound as of a single louddrum-tap. Decoud went back to the ravine. Nostromo, at thetiller, looked back from time to time at the vanishing mass ofthe Great Isabel, which, little by little, merged into theuniform texture of the night. At last, when he turned his headagain, he saw nothing but a smooth darkness, like a solid wall.Then he, too, experienced that feeling of solitude which hadweighed heavily on Decoud after the lighter had slipped off theshore. But while the man on the island was oppressed by a bizarresense of unreality affecting the very ground upon which hewalked, the mind of the Capataz of the Cargadores turned alertlyto the problem of future conduct. Nostromo's faculties, workingon parallel lines, enabled him to steer straight, to keep alook-out for Hermosa, near which he had to pass, and to try toimagine what would happen tomorrow in Sulaco. To-morrow, or, as amatter of fact, to-day, since the dawn was not very far, Sotillowould find out in what way the treasure had gone. A gang ofCargadores had been employed in loading it into a railway truckfrom the Custom House store-rooms, and running the truck on tothe wharf. There would be arrests made, and certainly before noonSotillo would know in what manner the silver had left Sulaco, andwho it was that took it out.Nostromo's intention had been to sail right into the harbour; butat this thought by a sudden touch of the tiller he threw thelighter into the wind and checked her rapid way. Hisre-appearance with the very boat would raise suspicions, wouldcause surmises, would absolutely put Sotillo on the track. Hehimself would be arrested; and once in the Calabozo there was nosaying what they would do to him to make him speak.  He trustedhimself, but he stood up to look round.  Near by, Hermosa showedlow its white surface as flat as a table, with the slight run ofthe sea raised by the breeze washing over its edges noisily. Thelighter must be sunk at once.He allowed her to drift with her sail aback. There was already agood deal of water in her. He allowed her to drift towards theharbour entrance, and, letting the tiller swing about, squatteddown and busied himself in loosening the plug. With that out shewould fill very quickly, and every lighter carried a little ironballast--enough to make her go down when full of water. When hestood up again the noisy wash about the Hermosa sounded far away,almost inaudible; and already he could make out the shape of landabout the harbour entrance. This was a desperate affair, and hewas a good swimmer. A mile was nothing to him, and he knew of aneasy place for landing just below the earthworks of the oldabandoned fort. It occurred to him with a peculiar fascinationthat this fort was a good place in which to sleep the day throughafter so many sleepless nights.With one blow of the tiller he unshipped for the purpose, heknocked the plug out, but did not take the trouble to lower thesail. He felt the water welling up heavily about his legs beforehe leaped on to the taffrail.  There, upright and motionless, inhis shirt and trousers only, he stood waiting. When he had felther settle he sprang far away with a mighty splash.At once he turned his head. The gloomy, clouded dawn from behindthe mountains showed him on the smooth waters the upper corner ofthe sail, a dark wet triangle of canvas waving slightly to andfro. He saw it vanish, as if jerked under, and then struck outfor the shore.PART THIRDTHE LIGHTHOUSECHAPTER ONEDIRECTLY the cargo boat had slipped away from the wharf and gotlost in the darkness of the harbour the Europeans of Sulacoseparated, to prepare for the coming of the Monterist regime,which was approaching Sulaco from the mountains, as well as fromthe sea.This bit of manual work in loading the silver was their lastconcerted action. It ended the three days of danger, duringwhich, according to the newspaper press of Europe, their energyhad preserved the town from the calamities of popular disorder.At the shore end of the jetty, Captain Mitchell said good-nightand turned back. His intention was to walk the planks of thewharf till the steamer from Esmeralda turned up. The engineers ofthe railway staff, collecting their Basque and Italian workmen,marched them away to the railway yards, leaving the Custom House,so well defended on the first day of the riot, standing open tothe four winds of heaven. Their men had conducted themselvesbravely and faithfully during the famous "three days" of Sulaco.In a great part this faithfulness and that courage had beenexercised in self-defence rather than in the cause of thosematerial interests to which Charles Gould had pinned his faith.Amongst the cries of the mob not the least loud had been the cryof death to foreigners. It was, indeed, a lucky circumstance forSulaco that the relations of those imported workmen with thepeople of the country had been uniformly bad from the first.Doctor Monygham, going to the door of Viola's kitchen, observedthis retreat marking the end of the foreign interference, thiswithdrawal of the army of material progress from the field ofCostaguana revolutions.Algarrobe torches carried on the outskirts of the moving bodysent their penetrating aroma into his nostrils. Their light,sweeping along the front of the house, made the letters of theinscription, "Albergo d'ltalia Una," leap out black from end toend of the long wall. His eyes blinked in the clear blaze.Several young men, mostly fair and tall, shepherding this mob ofdark bronzed heads, surmounted by the glint of slanting riflebarrels, nodded to him familiarly as they went by. The doctor wasa well-known character.  Some of them wondered what he was doingthere.  Then, on the flank of their workmen they tramped on,following the line of rails."Withdrawing your people from the harbour?" said the doctor,addressing himself to the chief engineer of the railway, who hadaccompanied Charles Gould so far on his way to the town, walkingby the side of the horse, with his hand on the saddle-bow. Theyhad stopped just outside the open door to let the workmen crossthe road."As quick as I can. We are not a political faction," answered theengineer, meaningly. "And we are not going to give our new rulersa handle against the railway.  You approve me, Gould?""Absolutely," said Charles Gould's impassive voice, high up andoutside the dim parallelogram of light falling on the roadthrough the open door.With Sotillo expected from one side, and Pedro Montero from theother, the engineer-in-chief's only anxiety now was to avoid acollision with either. Sulaco, for him, was a railway station, aterminus, workshops, a great accumulation of stores. As againstthe mob the railway defended its property, but politically therailway was neutral. He was a brave man; and in that spirit ofneutrality he had carried proposals of truce to theself-appointed chiefs of the popular party, the deputies Fuentesand Gamacho. Bullets were still flying about when he had crossedthe Plaza on that mission, waving above his head a white napkinbelonging to the table linen of the Amarilla Club.He was rather proud of this exploit; and reflecting that thedoctor, busy all day with the wounded in the patio of the CasaGould, had not had time to hear the news, he began a succinctnarrative. He had communicated to them the intelligence from theConstruction Camp as to Pedro Montero. The brother of thevictorious general, he had assured them, could be expected atSulaco at any time now. This news (as he anticipated), whenshouted out of the window by Senor Gamacho, induced a rush of themob along the Campo Road towards Rincon. The two deputies also,after shaking hands with him effusively, mounted and galloped offto meet the great man. "I have misled them a little as to thetime," the chief engineer confessed.  "However hard he rides, hecan scarcely get here before the morning. But my object isattained.  I've secured several hours' peace for the losingparty.  But I did not tell them anything about Sotillo, for fearthey would take it into their heads to try to get hold of theharbour again, either to oppose him or welcome him--there's nosaying which. There was Gould's silver, on which rests theremnant of our hopes. Decoud's retreat had to be thought of, too.I think the railway has done pretty well by its friends withoutcompromising itself hopelessly. Now the parties must be left tothemselves.""Costaguana for the Costaguaneros," interjected the doctor,sardonically. "It is a fine country, and they have raised a finecrop of hates, vengeance, murder, and rapine--those sons of thecountry.""Well, I am one of them," Charles Gould's voice sounded, calmly,"and I must be going on to see to my own crop of trouble. My wifehas driven straight on, doctor?""Yes. All was quiet on this side. Mrs. Gould has taken the twogirls with her."Charles Gould rode on, and the engineer-in-chief followed thedoctor indoors."That man is calmness personified," he said, appreciatively,dropping on a bench, and stretching his well-shaped legs incycling stockings nearly across the doorway.  "He must beextremely sure of himself.""If that's all he is sure of, then he is sure of nothing," saidthe doctor. He had perched himself again on the end of the table.He nursed his cheek in the palm of one hand, while the othersustained the elbow. "It is the last thing a man ought to be sureof." The candle, half-consumed and burning dimly with a longwick, lighted up from below his inclined face, whose expressionaffected by the drawn-in cicatrices in the cheeks, had somethingvaguely unnatural, an exaggerated remorseful bitterness. As hesat there he had the air of meditating upon sinister things. Theengineer-in-chief gazed at him for a time before he protested."I really don't see that. For me there seems to be nothing else.However----"He was a wise man, but he could not quite conceal his contemptfor that sort of paradox; in fact. Dr.  Monygham was not liked bythe Europeans of Sulaco.  His outward aspect of an outcast, whichhe preserved even in Mrs. Gould's drawing-room, provokedunfavourable criticism. There could be no doubt of hisintelligence; and as he had lived for over twenty years in thecountry, the pessimism of his outlook could not be altogetherignored. But instinctively, in self-defence of their activitiesand hopes, his hearers put it to the account of some hiddenimperfection in the man's character. It was known that many yearsbefore, when quite young, he had been made by Guzman Bento chiefmedical officer of the army. Not one of the Europeans then in theservice of Costaguana had been so much liked and trusted by thefierce old Dictator.Afterwards his story was not so clear. It lost itself amongst theinnumerable tales of conspiracies and plots against the tyrant asa stream is lost in an arid belt of sandy country before itemerges, diminished and troubled, perhaps, on the other side. Thedoctor made no secret of it that he had lived for years in thewildest parts of the Republic, wandering with almost unknownIndian tribes in the great forests of the far interior where thegreat rivers have their sources. But it was mere aimlesswandering; he had written nothing, collected nothing, broughtnothing for science out of the twilight of the forests, whichseemed to cling to his battered personality limping about Sulaco,where it had drifted in casually, only to get stranded on theshores of the sea.It was also known that he had lived in a state of destitutiontill the arrival of the Goulds from Europe.  Don Carlos and DonaEmilia had taken up the mad English doctor, when it becameapparent that for all his savage independence he could be tamedby kindness.  Perhaps it was only hunger that had tamed him. Inyears gone by he had certainly been acquainted with CharlesGould's father in Sta. Marta; and now, no matter what were thedark passages of his history, as the medical officer of the SanTome mine he became a recognized personality. He was recognized,but not unreservedly accepted. So much defiant eccentricity andsuch an outspoken scorn for mankind seemed to point to mererecklessness of judgment, the bravado of guilt.  Besides, sincehe had become again of some account, vague whispers had beenheard that years ago, when fallen into disgrace and thrown intoprison by Guzman Bento at the time of the so-called GreatConspiracy, he had betrayed some of his best friends amongst theconspirators. Nobody pretended to believe that whisper; the wholestory of the Great Conspiracy was hopelessly involved andobscure; it is admitted in Costaguana that there never had been aconspiracy except in the diseased imagination of the Tyrant; and,therefore, nothing and no one to betray; though the mostdistinguished Costaguaneros had been imprisoned and executed uponthat accusation. The procedure had dragged on for years,decimating the better class like a pestilence. The mereexpression of sorrow for the fate of executed kinsmen had beenpunished with death.  Don Jose Avellanos was perhaps the only oneliving who knew the whole story of those unspeakable cruelties.He had suffered from them himself, and he, with a shrug of theshoulders and a nervous, jerky gesture of the arm, was wont toput away from him, as it were, every allusion to it. But whateverthe reason, Dr.  Monygham, a personage in the administration ofthe Gould Concession, treated with reverent awe by the miners,and indulged in his peculiarities by Mrs.  Gould, remainedsomehow outside the pale.It was not from any liking for the doctor that theengineer-in-chief had lingered in the inn upon the plain.  Heliked old Viola much better. He had come to look upon the Albergod'ltalia Una as a dependence of the railway. Many of hissubordinates had their quarters there. Mrs. Gould's interest inthe family conferred upon it a sort of distinction.  Theengineer-in-chief, with an army of workers under his orders,appreciated the moral influence of the old Garibaldino upon hiscountrymen. His austere, old-world Republicanism had a severe,soldier-like standard of faithfulness and duty, as if the worldwere a battlefield where men had to fight for the sake ofuniversal love and brotherhood, instead of a more or less largeshare of booty."Poor old chap!" he said, after he had heard the doctor's accountof Teresa. "He'll never be able to keep the place going byhimself. I shall be sorry.""He's quite alone up there," grunted Doctor Monygham, with a tossof his heavy head towards the narrow staircase. "Every livingsoul has cleared out, and Mrs.  Gould took the girls away justnow. It might not be over-safe for them out here before verylong. Of course, as a doctor I can do nothing more here; but shehas asked me to stay with old Viola, and as I have no horse toget back to the mine, where I ought to be, I made no difficultyto stay. They can do without me in the town.""I have a good mind to remain with you, doctor, till we seewhether anything happens to-night at the harbour," declared theengineer-in-chief. "He must not be molested by Sotillo'ssoldiery, who may push on as far as this at once. Sotillo used tobe very cordial to me at the Goulds' and at the club. How thatman'll ever dare to look any of his friends here in the face Ican't imagine.""He'll no doubt begin by shooting some of them to get over thefirst awkwardness," said the doctor.  "Nothing in this countryserves better your military man who has changed sides than a fewsummary executions." He spoke with a gloomy positiveness thatleft no room for protest. The engineer-in-chief did not attemptany. He simply nodded several times regretfully, then said--"I think we shall be able to mount you in the morning, doctor.Our peons have recovered some of our stampeded horses. By ridinghard and taking a wide circuit by Los Hatos and along the edge ofthe forest, clear of Rincon altogether, you may hope to reach theSan Tome bridge without being interfered with. The mine is justnow, to my mind, the safest place for anybody at all compromised.I only wish the railway was as difficult to touch.""Am I compromised?" Doctor Monygham brought out slowly after ashort silence."The whole Gould Concession is compromised. It could not haveremained for ever outside the political life of the country--ifthose convulsions may be called life. The thing is--can it betouched? The moment was bound to come when neutrality wouldbecome impossible, and Charles Gould understood this well. Ibelieve he is prepared for every extremity. A man of his sort hasnever contemplated remaining indefinitely at the mercy ofignorance and corruption. It was like being a prisoner in acavern of banditti with the price of your ransom in your pocket,and buying your life from day to day. Your mere safety, not yourliberty, mind, doctor. I know what I am talking about. The imageat which you shrug your shoulders is perfectly correct,especially if you conceive such a prisoner endowed with the powerof replenishing his pocket by means as remote from the facultiesof his captors as if they were magic.  You must have understoodthat as well as I do, doctor.  He was in the position of thegoose with the golden eggs. I broached this matter to him as farback as Sir John's visit here. The prisoner of stupid and greedybanditti is always at the mercy of the first imbecile ruffian,who may blow out his brains in a fit of temper or for someprospect of an immediate big haul. The tale of killing the goosewith the golden eggs has not been evolved for nothing out of thewisdom of mankind. It is a story that will never grow old. Thatis why Charles Gould in his deep, dumb way has countenanced theRibierist Mandate, the first public act that promised him safetyon other than venal grounds. Ribierism has failed, as everythingmerely rational fails in this country. But Gould remains logicalin wishing to save this big lot of silver. Decoud's plan of acounter-revolution may be practicable or not, it may have achance, or it may not have a chance. With all my experience ofthis revolutionary continent, I can hardly yet look at theirmethods seriously. Decoud has been reading to us his draft of aproclamation, and talking very well for  Jack two hours about his planof action. He had arguments which should have appeared solidenough if we, members of old, stable political and nationalorganizations, were not startled by the mere idea of a new Stateevolved like this out of the head of a scoffing young man fleeingfor his life, with a proclamation in his pocket, to a rough,jeering, half-bred swashbuckler, who in this part of the world iscalled a general.  It sounds like a comic fairy tale--and behold,it may come off; because it is true to the very spirit of thecountry.""Is the silver gone off, then?" asked the doctor, moodily.The chief engineer pulled out his watch. "By Captain Mitchell'sreckoning--and he ought to know--it has been gone long enoughnow to be some three or four miles outside the harbour; and, asMitchell says, Nostromo is the sort of seaman to make the best ofhis opportunities." Here the doctor grunted so heavily that theother changed his tone."You have a poor opinion of that move, doctor? But why? CharlesGould has got to play his game out, though he is not the man toformulate his conduct even to himself, perhaps, let alone toothers. It may be that the game has been partly suggested to himby Holroyd; but it accords with his character, too; and that iswhy it has been so successful. Haven't they come to calling him'El Rey de Sulaco' in Sta. Marta? A nickname may be the bestrecord of a success. That's what I call putting the face of ajoke upon the body of a truth. My dear sir, when I first arrivedin Sta. Marta I was struck by the way all those journalists,demagogues, members of Congress, and all those generals andjudges cringed before a sleepy-eyed advocate without practicesimply because he was the plenipotentiary of the GouldConcession.  Sir John and Jack when he came out was impressed, too.""A new State, with that plump dandy, Decoud, for the firstPresident," mused Dr. Monygham, nursing his cheek and swinginghis legs all the time."Upon my word, and why not?" the chief engineer retorted in anunexpectedly earnest and confidential voice. It was as ifsomething subtle in the air of Costaguana had inoculated him withthe local faith in "pronunciamientos." All at once he began totalk, like an expert revolutionist, of the instrument ready tohand in the intact army at Cayta, which could be brought back ina few days to Sulaco if only Decoud managed to make his way atonce down the coast. For the military chief there was Barrios,who had nothing but a bullet to expect from Montero, his formerprofessional rival and bitter enemy. Barrios's concurrence wasassured. As to his army, it had nothing to expect from Monteroeither; not even a month's pay. From that point of view theexistence of the treasure was of enormous importance. The mereknowledge that it had been saved from the Monterists would be astrong inducement for the Cayta troops to embrace the cause ofthe new State.The doctor turned round and contemplated his companion for sometime."This Decoud, I see, is a persuasive young beggar," he remarkedat last. "And pray is it for this, then, that Charles Gould haslet the whole lot of ingots go out to sea in charge of thatNostromo?""Charles Gould," said the engineer-in-chief, "has said no moreabout his motive than usual. You know, he doesn't talk. But weall here know his motive, and he has only one--the safety of theSan Tome mine with the preservation of the Gould Concession inthe spirit of his compact with Holroyd. Holroyd is anotheruncommon man. They understand each other's imaginative side. Oneis thirty, the other nearly sixty, and they have been made foreach other. To be a millionaire, Jack and such a millionaire asHolroyd, is like being eternally young. The audacity of youthreckons upon what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal;but a millionaire has unlimited means in his hand--which isbetter. One's time on earth is an uncertain quantity, but aboutthe long reach of millions there is no doubt.  The introductionof a pure form of Christianity into this continent is a dream fora youthful enthusiast, and I have been trying to explain to youwhy Holroyd at fifty-eight is like a man on the threshold oflife, and better, too. He's not a missionary, but the San Tomemine holds just that for him. I assure you, in sober truth, thathe could not manage to keep this out of a strictly businessconference upon the finances of Costaguana he had with Sir John acouple of years ago.  Sir John mentioned it with amazement in aletter he wrote to me here, from San Francisco, when on his wayhome. Upon my word, doctor, things seem to be worth nothing bywhat they are in themselves. I begin to believe that the onlysolid thing about them is the spiritual value which everyonediscovers in his own form of activity----""Bah!" interrupted the doctor, without stopping for an instantthe idle swinging movement of his legs.  "Self-flattery. Food forthat vanity which makes the world go round. Jack Jack Jack Meantime, what do youthink is going to happen to the treasure floating about the gulfwith the great Capataz and the great politician?""Why are you uneasy about it, doctor?""I uneasy! And what the devil is it to me? I put no spiritualvalue into my desires, or my opinions, or my actions. They havenot enough vastness to give me room for self-flattery. Look, forinstance, I should certainly have liked to ease the last momentsof that poor woman. And I can't. It's impossible. Have you metthe impossible face to face--or have you, the Napoleon ofrailways, no such word in your dictionary?""Is she bound to have a very bad time of it?" asked the chiefengineer, with humane concern.Slow, heavy footsteps moved across the planks above the heavyhard wood beams of the kitchen. Then down the narrow opening ofthe staircase made in the thickness of the wall, and narrowenough to be defended by one man against twenty enemies, came themurmur of two voices, one faint and broken, the other deep andgentle answering it, and in its graver tone covering the weakersound.The two men remained still and silent till the murmurs ceased,then the doctor shrugged his shoulders and muttered--"Yes, she's bound to. And I could do nothing if I went up now."A long period of silence above and below ensued."I fancy," began the engineer, in a subdued voice, "that youmistrust Captain Mitchell's Capataz.""Mistrust him!" muttered the doctor through his teeth. "I believehim capable of anything--even of the most absurd fidelity. I amthe last person he spoke to before he left the wharf, you know.The poor woman up there wanted to see him, and I let him go up toher. The dying must not be contradicted, you know. She seemedthen fairly calm and resigned, but the scoundrel in those tenminutes or so has done or said something which seems to havedriven her into despair. You know," went on the doctor,hesitatingly, "women are so very unaccountable in every position,and at all times of life, that I thought sometimes she was in away, don't you see? in love with him--the Capataz. The rascal hashis own charm indubitably, or he would not have made the conquestof all the populace of the town. No, no, I am not absurd. I mayhave given a wrong name to some strong sentiment for him on herpart, to an unreasonable and simple attitude a woman is apt totake up emotionally towards a man. She used to abuse him to mefrequently, which, of course, is not inconsistent with my idea.Not at all. It looked to me as if she were always thinking ofhim. He was something important in her life. You know, I haveseen a lot of those people.  Whenever I came down from the mineMrs. Gould used to ask me to keep my eye on them. She likesItalians; she has lived a long time in Italy, I believe, and shetook a special fancy to that old Garibaldino. A remarkable chapenough. A rugged and dreamy character, living in therepublicanism of his young days as if in a cloud.  He hasencouraged much of the Capataz's confounded nonsense--thehigh-strung, exalted old beggar!""What sort of nonsense?" wondered the chief engineer.  "I foundthe Capataz always a very shrewd and sensible fellow, absolutelyfearless, and remarkably useful. A perfect handy man. Sir Johnwas greatly impressed by his resourcefulness and attention whenhe made that overland journey from Sta. Marta. Later on, as youmight have heard, he rendered us a service by disclosing to thethen chief of police the presence in the town of someprofessional thieves, who came from a distance to wreck and robour monthly pay train. He has certainly organized the lighterageservice of the harbour for the O.S.N. Company with great ability.He knows how to make himself obeyed, foreigner though he is. Itis true that the Cargadores are strangers here, too, for the mostpart--immigrants, Islenos.""His prestige is his fortune," muttered the doctor, sourly."The man has proved his trustworthiness up to the hilt oninnumerable occasions and in all sorts of ways," argued theengineer. "When this question of the silver arose, CaptainMitchell naturally was very warmly of the opinion that hisCapataz was the only man fit for the trust. As a sailor, ofcourse, I suppose so. But as a man, don't you know, Gould,Decoud, and myself judged that it didn't matter in the least whowent.  Any boatman would have done just as well. Pray, what coulda thief do with such a lot of ingots? If he ran off with them hewould have in the end to land somewhere, and how could he concealhis cargo from the knowledge of the people ashore? We dismissedthat consideration from our minds. Moreover, Decoud was going.There have been occasions when the Capataz has been moreimplicitly trusted.""He took a slightly different view," the doctor said.  "I heardhim declare in this very room that it would be the most desperateaffair of his life. He made a sort of verbal will here in myhearing, appointing old Viola his executor; and, by Jove! do youknow, he--he's not grown rich by his fidelity to you good peopleof the railway and the harbour. I suppose he obtains some--howdo you say that?--some spiritual value for his labours, or else Idon't know why the devil he should be faithful to you, Gould,Mitchell, or anybody else.  He knows this country well. He knows,for instance, that Gamacho, the Deputy from Javira, has beennothing else but a 'tramposo' of the commonest sort, a pettypedlar of the Campo, till he managed to get enough goods oncredit from Anzani to open a little store in the wilds, and gothimself elected by the drunken mozos that hang about theEstancias and the poorest sort of rancheros who were in his debt.And Gamacho, who to-morrow will be probably one of our highofficials, is a stranger, too--an Isleno. He might have been aCargador on the O. S. N. wharf had he not (the posadero of Rinconis ready to swear it) murdered a pedlar in the woods and stolenhis pack to begin life on. And do you think that Gamacho, then,would have ever become a hero with the democracy of this place,like our Capataz?  Of course not. He isn't half the man. No;decidedly, I think that Nostromo is a fool."The doctor's talk was distasteful to the builder of railways. "Itis impossible to argue that point," he said, philosophically."Each man has his gifts. You should have heard Gamacho haranguinghis friends in the street.  He has a howling voice, and heshouted like mad, lifting his clenched fist right above his head,and throwing his body half out of the window. At every pause therabble below yelled, 'Down with the Oligarchs! Viva la Libertad!'Fuentes inside looked extremely miserable. You know, he is thebrother of Jorge Fuentes, who has been Minister of the Interiorfor six months or so, some few years back. Of course, he has noconscience; but he is a man of birth and education--at one timethe director of the Customs of Cayta.  That idiot-brute Gamachofastened himself upon him with his following of the lowestrabble. His sickly fear of that ruffian was the most rejoicingsight imaginable."He got up and went to the door to look out towards the harbour."All quiet," he said; "I wonder if Sotillo really means to turnup here?"CHAPTER TWOCAPTAIN MITCHELL, pacing the wharf, was asking himself the samequestion. There was always the doubt whether the warning of theEsmeralda telegraphist--a fragmentary and interruptedmessage--had been properly understood. However, the good man hadmade up his mind not to go to bed till daylight, if even then. Heimagined himself to have rendered an enormous service to CharlesGould. When he thought of the saved silver he rubbed his handstogether with satisfaction. In his simple way he was proud atbeing a party to this extremely clever expedient. It was he whohad given it a practical shape by suggesting the possibility ofintercepting at sea the north-bound steamer. And it wasadvantageous to his Company, too, which would have lost avaluable freight if the treasure had been left ashore to beconfiscated. The pleasure of disappointing the Monterists wasalso very great. Authoritative by temperament and the long habitof command, Captain Mitchell was no democrat.  He even went sofar as to profess a contempt for parliamentarism itself. "HisExcellency Don Vincente Ribiera," he used to say, "whom I andthat fellow of mine, Nostromo, had the honour, sir, and thepleasure of saving from a cruel death, deferred too much to hisCongress. It was a mistake--a distinct mistake, sir."The guileless old seaman superintending the O.S.N.  serviceimagined that the last three days had exhausted every startlingsurprise the political life of Costaguana could offer. He used toconfess afterwards that the events which followed surpassed hisimagination. To begin with, Sulaco (because of the seizure of thecables and the disorganization of the steam service) remained fora whole fortnight cut off from the rest of the world like abesieged city."One would not have believed it possible; but so it was, sir. Afull fortnight."The account of the extraordinary things that happened during thattime, and the powerful emotions he experienced, acquired a comicimpressiveness from the pompous manner of his personal narrative.He opened it always by assuring his hearer that he was "in thethick of things from first to last." Then he would begin bydescribing the getting away of the silver, and his naturalanxiety lest "his fellow" in charge of the lighter should makesome mistake. Apart from the loss of so much precious metal, thelife of Senor Martin Decoud, an agreeable, wealthy, andwell-informed young gentleman, would have been jeopardizedthrough his falling into the hands of his political enemies.Captain Mitchell also admitted that in his solitary vigil on thewharf he had felt a certain measure of concern for the future ofthe whole country."A feeling, sir," he explained, "perfectly comprehensible in aman properly grateful for the many kindnesses received from thebest families of merchants and other native gentlemen ofindependent means, who, barely saved by us from the excesses ofthe mob, seemed, to my mind's eye, destined to become the prey inperson and fortune of the native soldiery, which, as is wellknown, behave with regrettable barbarity to the inhabitantsduring their civil commotions. And then, sir, there were theGoulds, for both of whom, man and wife, I could not but entertainthe warmest feelings deserved by their hospitality and kindness.I felt, too, the dangers of the gentlemen of the Amarilla Club,who had made me honorary member, and had treated me with uniformregard and civility, both in my capacity of Consular Agent and asSuperintendent of an important Steam Service. Miss AntoniaAvellanos, the most beautiful and accomplished young lady whom ithad ever been my privilege to speak to, was not a little in mymind, I confess. How the interests of my Company would beaffected by the impending change of officials claimed a largeshare of my attention, too.  In short, sir, I was extremelyanxious and very tired, as you may suppose, by the exciting andmemorable events in which I had taken my little part. TheCompany's building containing my residence was within fiveminutes' walk, with the attraction of some supper and of myhammock (I always take my nightly rest in a hammock, as the mostsuitable to the climate); but somehow, sir, though evidently Icould do nothing for any one by remaining about, I could not tearmyself away from that wharf, where the fatigue made me stumblepainfully at times. The night was excessively dark--the darkestI remember in my life; so that I began to think that the arrivalof the transport from Esmeralda could not possibly take placebefore daylight, owing to the difficulty of navigating the gulf.The mosquitoes bit like fury. We have been infested here withmosquitoes before the late improvements; a peculiar harbourbrand, sir, renowned for its ferocity. They were like a cloudabout my head, and I shouldn't wonder that but for their attacksI would have dozed off as I walked up and down, and got a heavyfall. I kept on smoking cigar after cigar, more to protect myselffrom being eaten up alive than from any real relish for the weed.Then, sir, when perhaps for the twentieth time I was approachingmy watch to the lighted end in order to see the time, andobserving with surprise that it wanted yet ten minutes tomidnight, I heard the splash of a ship's propeller--anunmistakable sound to a sailor's ear on such a calm night. It wasfaint indeed, because they were advancing with precaution anddead slow, both on account of the darkness and from their desireof not revealing too soon their presence: a very unnecessarycare, because, I verily believe, in all the enormous extent ofthis harbour I was the only living soul about. Even the usualstaff of watchmen and others had been absent from their posts forseveral nights owing to the disturbances. I stood stock still,after dropping and stamping out my cigar--a circumstance highlyagreeable, I should think, to the mosquitoes, if I may judge fromthe state of my face next morning.  But that was a triflinginconvenience in comparison with the brutal proceedings I becamevictim of on the part of Sotillo. Something utterlyinconceivable, sir; more like the proceedings of a maniac thanthe action of a sane man, however lost to all sense of honour anddecency. But Sotillo was furious at the failure of his thievishscheme."In this Captain Mitchell was right. Sotillo was indeedinfuriated. Captain Mitchell, however, had not been arrested atonce; a vivid curiosity induced him to remain on the wharf (whichis nearly four hundred feet long) to see, or rather hear, thewhole process of disembarkation.  Concealed by the railway truckused for the silver, which had been run back afterwards to theshore end of the jetty, Captain Mitchell saw the small detachmentthrown forward, pass by, taking different directions upon theplain. Meantime, the troops were being landed and formed into acolumn, whose head crept up gradually so close to him that hemade it out, barring nearly the whole width of the wharf, only avery few yards from him. Then the low, shuffling, murmuring,clinking sounds ceased, and the whole mass remained for about anhour motionless and silent, awaiting the return of the scouts. Onland nothing was to be heard except the deep baying of themastiffs at the railway yards, answered by the faint barking ofthe curs infesting the outer limits of the town. A detached knotof dark shapes stood in front of the head of the column.Presently the picket at the end of the wharf began to challengein undertones single figures approaching from the plain. Thosemessengers sent back from the scouting parties flung to theircomrades brief sentences and passed on rapidly, becoming lost inthe great motionless mass, to make their report to the Staff. Itoccurred to Captain Mitchell that his position could becomedisagreeable and perhaps dangerous, when suddenly, at the head ofthe jetty, there was a shout of command, a bugle call, followedby a stir and a rattling of arms, and a murmuring noise that ranright up the column. Near by a loud voice directed hurriedly,"Push that railway car out of the way!" At the rush of bare feetto execute the order Captain Mitchell skipped back a pace or two;the car, suddenly impelled by many hands, flew away from himalong the rails, and before he knew what had happened he foundhimself surrounded and seized by his arms and the collar of hiscoat."We have caught a man hiding here, mi teniente!" cried one of hiscaptors."Hold him on one side till the rearguard comes along," answeredthe voice. The whole column streamed past Captain Mitchell at arun, the thundering noise of their feet dying away suddenly onthe shore.  His captors held him tightly, disregarding hisdeclaration that he was an Englishman and his loud demands to betaken at once before their commanding officer.  Finally he lapsedinto dignified silence. With a hollow rumble of wheels on theplanks a couple of field guns, dragged by hand, rolled by. Then,after a small body of men had marched past escorting four or fivefigures which walked in advance, with a jingle of steelscabbards, he felt a tug at his arms, and was ordered to comealong. During the passage from the wharf to the Custom House itis to be feared that Captain Mitchell was subjected to certainindignities at the hands of the soldiers--such as jerks, thumpson the neck, forcible application of the butt of a rifle to thesmall of his back.  Their ideas of speed were not in accord withhis notion of his dignity. He became flustered, flushed, andhelpless.  It was as if the world were coming to an end.The long building was surrounded by troops, which were alreadypiling arms by companies and preparing to pass the night lying onthe ground in their ponchos with their sacks under their heads.Corporals moved with swinging lanterns posting sentries all roundthe walls wherever there was a door or an opening. Sotillo wastaking his measures to protect his conquest as if it had indeedcontained the treasure. His desire to make his fortune at oneaudacious stroke of genius had overmastered his reasoningfaculties. He would not believe in the possibility of failure;the mere hint of such a thing made his brain reel with rage.Every circumstance pointing to it appeared incredible. Thestatement of Hirsch, which was so absolutely fatal to his hopes,could by no means be admitted. It is true, too, that Hirsch'sstory had been told so incoherently, with such excessive signs ofdistraction, that it really looked improbable. It was extremelydifficult, as the saying is, to make head or tail of it. On thebridge of the steamer, directly after his rescue, Sotillo and hisofficers, in their impatience and excitement, would not give thewretched man time to collect such few wits as remained to him. Heought to have been quieted, soothed, and reassured, whereas hehad been roughly handled, cuffed, shaken, and addressed inmenacing tones. His struggles, his wriggles, his attempts to getdown on his knees, followed by the most violent efforts to breakaway, as if he meant incontinently to jump overboard, his shrieksand shrinkings and cowering wild glances had filled them firstwith amazement, then with a doubt of his genuineness, as men arewont to suspect the sincerity of every great passion. HisSpanish, too, became so mixed up with German that the better halfof his statements remained incomprehensible. He tried topropitiate them by calling them hochwohlgeboren herren, which initself sounded suspicious. When admonished sternly not to triflehe repeated his entreaties and protestations of loyalty andinnocence again in German, obstinately, because he was not awarein what language he was speaking. His identity, of course, wasperfectly known as an inhabitant of Esmeralda, but this made thematter no clearer. As he kept on forgetting Decoud's name, mixinghim up with several other people he had seen in the Casa Gould,it looked as if they all had been in the lighter together; andfor a moment Sotillo thought that he had drowned every prominentRibierist of Sulaco. The improbability of such a thing threw adoubt upon the whole statement. Hirsch was either mad or playinga part--pretending fear and distraction on the spur of themoment to cover the truth. Sotillo's rapacity, excited to thehighest pitch by the prospect of an immense booty, could believein nothing adverse. This Jew might have been very much frightenedby the accident, but he knew where the silver was concealed, andhad invented this story, with his Jewish cunning, to put himentirely off the track as to what had been done.Sotillo had taken up his quarters on the upper floor in a vastapartment with heavy black beams. But there was no ceiling, andthe eye lost itself in the darkness under the high pitch of theroof. The thick shutters stood open. On a long table could beseen a large inkstand, some stumpy, inky quill pens, and twosquare wooden boxes, each holding half a hundred-weight of sand.Sheets of grey coarse official paper bestrewed the floor. It musthave been a room occupied by some higher official of the Customs,because a large leathern armchair stood behind the table, withother high-backed chairs scattered about. A net hammock was swungunder one of the beams--for the official's afternoon siesta, nodoubt. A couple of candles stuck into tall iron candlesticks gavea dim reddish light. The colonel's hat, sword, and revolver laybetween them, and a couple of his more trusty officers loungedgloomily against the table. The colonel threw himself into thearmchair, and a big negro with a sergeant's stripes on his raggedsleeve, kneeling down, pulled off his boots. Sotillo's ebonymoustache contrasted violently with the livid colouring of hischeeks. His eyes were sombre and as if sunk very far into hishead. He seemed exhausted by his perplexities, languid withdisappointment; but when the sentry on the landing thrust hishead in to announce the arrival of a prisoner, he revived atonce."Let him be brought in," he shouted, fiercely.The door flew open, and Captain Mitchell, bareheaded, hiswaistcoat open, the bow of his tie under his ear, was hustledinto the room.Sotillo recognized him at once. He could not have hoped for amore precious capture; here was a man who could tell him, if hechose, everything he wished to know--and directly the problem ofhow best to make him talk to the point presented itself to hismind. The resentment of a foreign nation had no terrors forSotillo.  The might of the whole armed Europe would not haveprotected Captain Mitchell from insults and ill-usage, so well asthe quick reflection of Sotillo that this was an Englishman whowould most likely turn obstinate under bad treatment, and becomequite unmanageable. At all events, the colonel smoothed the scowlon his brow."What! The excellent Senor Mitchell!" he cried, in affecteddismay. The pretended anger of his swift advance and of hisshout, "Release the caballero at once," was so effective that theastounded soldiers positively sprang away from their prisoner.Thus suddenly deprived of forcible support, Captain Mitchellreeled as though about to fall. Sotillo took him familiarly underthe arm, led him to a chair, waved his hand at the room. "Go out,all of you," he commanded.When they had been left alone he stood looking down, irresoluteand silent, watching till Captain Mitchell had recovered hispower of speech.Here in his very grasp was one of the men concerned in theremoval of the silver. Sotillo's temperament was of that sortthat he experienced an ardent desire to beat him; just asformerly when negotiating with difficulty a loan from thecautious Anzani, his fingers always itched to take the shopkeeperby the throat. As to Captain Mitchell, the suddenness,unexpectedness, and general inconceivableness of this experiencehad confused his thoughts. Moreover, he was physically out ofbreath."I've been knocked down three times between this and the wharf,"he gasped out at last. "Somebody shall be made to pay for this."He had certainly stumbled more than once, and had been draggedalong for some distance before he could regain his stride.  Withhis recovered breath his indignation seemed to madden him. Hejumped up, crimson, all his white hair bristling, his eyesglaring vengefully, and shook violently the flaps of his ruinedwaistcoat before the disconcerted Sotillo. "Look! Those uniformedthieves of yours downstairs have robbed me of my watch."The old sailor's aspect was very threatening. Sotillo saw himselfcut off from the table on which his sabre and revolver werelying."I demand restitution and apologies," Mitchell thundered at him,quite beside himself. "From you!  Yes, from you!"For the space of a second or so the colonel stood with aperfectly stony expression of face; then, as Captain Mitchellflung out an arm towards the table as if to snatch up therevolver, Sotillo, with a yell of alarm, bounded to the door andwas gone in a flash, slamming it after him. Surprise calmedCaptain Mitchell's fury.  Behind the closed door Sotillo shoutedon the landing, and there was a great tumult of feet on thewooden staircase."Disarm him! Bind him!" the colonel could be heard vociferating.Captain Mitchell had just the time to glance once at the windows,with three perpendicular bars of iron each and some twenty feetfrom the ground, as he well knew, before the door flew open andthe rush upon him took place. In an incredibly short time hefound himself bound with many turns of a hide rope to ahigh-backed chair, so that his head alone remained free. Not tillthen did Sotillo, who had been leaning in the doorway tremblingvisibly, venture again within. The soldiers, picking up from thefloor the rifles they had dropped to grapple with the prisoner,filed out of the room. The officers remained leaning on theirswords and looking on."The watch! the watch!" raved the colonel, pacing to and fro likea tiger in a cage. "Give me that man's watch."It was true, that when searched for arms in the hall downstairs,before being taken into Sotillo's presence, Captain Mitchell hadbeen relieved of his watch and chain; but at the colonel'sclamour it was produced quickly enough, a corporal bringing itup, carried carefully in the palms of his joined hands. Sotillosnatched it, and pushed the clenched fist from which it dangledclose to Captain Mitchell's face."Now then! You arrogant Englishman! You dare to call the soldiersof the army thieves! Behold your watch."He flourished his fist as if aiming blows at the prisoner's nose.Captain Mitchell, helpless as a swathed infant, looked anxiouslyat the sixty-guinea gold half-chronometer, presented to him yearsago by a Committee of Underwriters for saving a ship from totalloss by fire. Sotillo, too, seemed to perceive its valuableappearance. He became silent suddenly, stepped aside to thetable, and began a careful examination in the light of thecandles. He had never seen anything so fine. His officers closedin and craned their necks behind his back.He became so interested that for an instant he forgot hisprecious prisoner. There is always something childish in therapacity of the passionate, clear-minded, Southern races, wantingin the misty idealism of the Northerners, who at the smallestencouragement dream of nothing less than the conquest of theearth. Sotillo was fond of jewels, gold trinkets, of personaladornment.  After a moment he turned about, and with a commandinggesture made all his officers fall back. He laid down the watchon the table, then, negligently, pushed his hat over it."Ha!" he began, going up very close to the chair.  "You dare callmy valiant soldiers of the Esmeralda regiment, thieves. You dare!What impudence! You foreigners come here to rob our country ofits wealth.  You never have enough! Your audacity knows nobounds."He looked towards the officers, amongst whom there was anapproving murmur. The older major was moved to declare--"Si, mi colonel. They are all traitors.""I shall say nothing," continued Sotillo, fixing the motionlessand powerless Mitchell with an angry but uneasy stare. "I shallsay nothing of your treacherous attempt to get possession of myrevolver to shoot me while I was trying to treat you withconsideration you did not deserve. You have forfeited your life.Your only hope is in my clemency."He watched for the effect of his words, but there was no obvioussign of fear on Captain Mitchell's face. His white hair was fullof dust, which covered also the rest of his helpless person. Asif he had heard nothing, he twitched an eyebrow to get rid of abit of straw which hung amongst the hairs.Sotillo advanced one leg and put his arms akimbo.  "It is you,Mitchell," he said, emphatically, "who are the thief, not mysoldiers!" He pointed at his prisoner a forefinger with a long,almond-shaped nail. "Where is the silver of the San Tome mine? Iask you, Mitchell, where is the silver that was deposited in thisCustom House? Answer me that! You stole it. You were a party tostealing it. It was stolen from the Government.  Aha! you think Ido not know what I say; but I am up to your foreign tricks. It isgone, the silver! No?  Gone in one of your lanchas, you miserableman! How dared you?"This time he produced his effect. "How on earth could Sotilloknow that?" thought Mitchell. His head, the only part of his bodythat could move, betrayed his surprise by a sudden jerk."Ha! you tremble," Sotillo shouted, suddenly. "It is aconspiracy. It is a crime against the State. Did you not knowthat the silver belongs to the Republic till the Governmentclaims are satisfied? Where is it?  Where have you hidden it, youmiserable thief?"At this question Captain Mitchell's sinking spirits revived.  Inwhatever incomprehensible manner Sotillo had already got hisinformation about the lighter, he had not captured it. That wasclear. In his outraged heart, Captain Mitchell had resolved thatnothing would induce him to say a word while he remained sodisgracefully bound, but his desire to help the escape of thesilver made him depart from this resolution. His wits were verymuch at work. He detected in Sotillo a certain air of doubt, ofirresolution."That man," he said to himself, "is not certain of what headvances." For all his pomposity in social intercourse, CaptainMitchell could meet the realities of life in a resolute and readyspirit. Now he had got over the first shock of the abominabletreatment he was cool and collected enough. The immense contempthe felt for Sotillo steadied him, and he said oracularly, "Nodoubt it is well concealed by this time."Sotillo, too, had time to cool down. "Muy bien, Mitchell," hesaid in a cold and threatening manner.  "But can you produce theGovernment receipt for the royalty and the Custom House permit ofembarkation, hey? Can you? No. Then the silver has been removedillegally, and the guilty shall be made to suffer, unless it isproduced within five days from this." He gave orders for theprisoner to be unbound and locked up in one of the smaller roomsdownstairs. He walked about the room, moody and silent, tillCaptain Mitchell, with each of his arms held by a couple of men,stood up, shook himself, and stamped his feet."How did you like to be tied up, Mitchell?" he asked, derisively."It is the most incredible, abominable use of power!" CaptainMitchell declared in a loud voice. "And whatever your purpose,you shall gain nothing from it, I can promise you."The tall colonel, livid, with his coal-black ringlets andmoustache, crouched, as it were, to look into the eyes of theshort, thick-set, red-faced prisoner with rumpled white hair."That we shall see. You shall know my power a little better whenI tie you up to a potalon outside in the sun for a whole day." Hedrew himself up haughtily, and made a sign for Captain Mitchellto be led away."What about my watch?" cried Captain Mitchell, hanging back fromthe efforts of the men pulling him towards the door.Sotillo turned to his officers. "No! But only listen to thispicaro, caballeros," he pronounced with affected scorn, and wasanswered by a chorus of derisive laughter.  "He demands hiswatch!" . . . He ran up again to Captain Mitchell, for the desireto relieve his feelings by inflicting blows and pain upon thisEnglishman was very strong within him. "Your watch! You are aprisoner in war time, Mitchell! In war time!  You have no rightsand no property! Caramba! The very breath in your body belongs tome. Remember that.""Bosh!" said Captain Mitchell, concealing a disagreeableimpression.Down below, in a great hall, with the earthen floor and with atall mound thrown up by white ants in a corner, the soldiers hadkindled a small fire with broken chairs and tables near thearched gateway, through which the faint murmur of the harbourwaters on the beach could be heard. While Captain Mitchell wasbeing led down the staircase, an officer passed him, running upto report to Sotillo the capture of more prisoners. A lot ofsmoke hung about in the vast gloomy place, the fire crackled,and, as if through a haze, Captain Mitchell made out, surroundedby short soldiers with fixed bayonets, the heads of three tallprisoners--the doctor, the engineer-in-chief, and the whiteleonine mane of old Viola, who stood half-turned away from theothers with his chin on his breast and his arms crossed.Mitchell's astonishment knew no bounds. He cried out; the othertwo exclaimed also.  But he hurried on, diagonally, across thebig cavern-like hall. Lots of thoughts, surmises, hints ofcaution, and so on, crowded his head to distraction."Is he actually keeping you?" shouted the chief engineer, whosesingle eyeglass glittered in the firelight.An officer from the top of the stairs was shouting urgently,"Bring them all up--all three."In the clamour of voices and the rattle of arms, Captain Mitchellmade himself heard imperfectly: "By heavens! the fellow hasstolen my watch."The engineer-in-chief on the staircase resisted the pressure longenough to shout, "What? What did you say?""My chronometer!" Captain Mitchell yelled violently at the verymoment of being thrust head foremost through a small door into asort of cell, perfectly black, and so narrow that he fetched upagainst the opposite wall. The door had been instantly slammed.He knew where they had put him. This was the strong room of theCustom House, whence the silver had been removed only a few hoursearlier. It was almost as narrow as a corridor, with a smallsquare aperture, barred by a heavy grating, at the distant end.Captain Mitchell staggered for a few steps, then sat down on theearthen floor with his back to the wall. Nothing, not even agleam of light from anywhere, interfered with Captain Mitchell'smeditation. He did some hard but not very extensive thinking. Itwas not of a gloomy cast. The old sailor, with all his smallweaknesses and absurdities, was constitutionally incapable ofentertaining for any length of time a fear of his personalsafety. It was not so much firmness of soul as the lack of acertain kind of imagination--the kind whose undue developmentcaused intense suffering to Senor Hirsch; that sort ofimagination which adds the blind terror of bodily suffering andof death, envisaged as an accident to the body alone,strictly--to all the other apprehensions on which the sense ofone's existence is based. Unfortunately, Captain Mitchell had notmuch penetration of any kind; characteristic, illuminatingtrifles of expression, action, or movement, escaped himcompletely. He was too pompously and innocently aware of his ownexistence to observe that of others.  For instance, he could notbelieve that Sotillo had been really afraid of him, and thissimply because it would never have entered into his head to shootany one except in the most pressing case of self-defence. Anybodycould see he was not a murdering kind of man, he reflected quitegravely. Then why this preposterous and insulting charge? heasked himself.   But his thoughts mainly clung around theastounding and unanswerable question: How the devil the fellowgot to know that the silver had gone off in the lighter? It wasobvious that he had not captured it. And, obviously, he could nothave captured it! In this last conclusion Captain Mitchell wasmisled by the assumption drawn from his observation of theweather during his long vigil on the wharf. He thought that therehad been much more wind than usual that night in the gulf;whereas, as a matter of fact, the reverse was the case."How in the name of all that's marvellous did that confoundedfellow get wind of the affair?" was the first question he askeddirectly after the bang, clatter, and flash of the open door(which was closed again almost before he could lift his droppedhead) informed him that he had a companion of captivity. Dr.Monygham's voice stopped muttering curses in English and Spanish."Is that you, Mitchell?" he made answer, surlily. "I struck myforehead against this confounded wall with enough force to fellan ox. Where are you?"Captain Mitchell, accustomed to the darkness, could make out thedoctor stretching out his hands blindly."I am sitting here on the floor. Don't fall over my legs,"Captain Mitchell's voice announced with great dignity of tone.The doctor, entreated not to walk about in the dark, sank down tothe ground, too. The two prisoners of Sotillo, with their headsnearly touching, began to exchange confidences."Yes," the doctor related in a low tone to Captain Mitchell'svehement curiosity, "we have been nabbed in old Viola's place. Itseems that one of their pickets, commanded by an officer, pushedas far as the town gate. They had orders not to enter, but tobring along every soul they could find on the plain. We had beentalking in there with the door open, and no doubt they saw theglimmer of our light. They must have been making their approachesfor some time. The engineer laid himself on a bench in a recessby the fire-place, and I went upstairs to have a look. I hadn'theard any sound from there for a long time. Old Viola, as soon ashe saw me come up, lifted his arm for silence. I stole in ontiptoe. By Jove, his wife was lying down and had gone to sleep.The woman had actually dropped off to sleep! 'Senor Doctor,'Viola whispers to me, 'it looks as if her oppression was going toget better.' 'Yes,' I said, very much surprised; 'your wife is awonderful woman, Giorgio.' Just then a shot was fired in thekitchen, which made us jump and cower as if at a thunder-clap.It seems that the party of soldiers had stolen quite close up,and one of them had crept up to the door. He looked in, thoughtthere was no one there, and, holding his rifle ready, enteredquietly. The chief told me that he had just closed his eyes for amoment.  When he opened them, he saw the man already in themiddle of the room peering into the dark corners. The chief wasso startled that, without thinking, he made one leap from therecess right out in front of the fireplace.  The soldier, no lessstartled, up with his rifle and pulls the trigger, deafening andsingeing the engineer, but in his flurry missing him completely.But, look what happens! At the noise of the report the sleepingwoman sat up, as if moved by a spring, with a shriek, 'Thechildren, Gian' Battista! Save the children!' I have it in myears now. It was the truest cry of distress I ever heard. I stoodas if paralyzed, but the old husband ran across to the bedside,stretching out his hands. She clung to them! I could see her eyesgo glazed; the old fellow lowered her down on the pillows andthen looked round at me. She was dead!  All this took less thanfive minutes, and then I ran down to see what was the matter. Itwas no use thinking of any resistance. Nothing we two could sayavailed with the officer, so I volunteered to go up with a coupleof soldiers and fetch down old Viola. He was sitting at the footof the bed, looking at his wife's face, and did not seem to hearwhat I said; but after I had pulled the sheet over her head, hegot up and followed us downstairs quietly, in a sort ofthoughtful way. They marched us off along the road, leaving thedoor open and the candle burning. The chief engineer strode onwithout a word, but I looked back once or twice at the feeblegleam. After we had gone some considerable distance, theGaribaldino, who was walking by my side, suddenly said, 'I haveburied many men on battlefields on this continent. The prieststalk of consecrated ground! Bah! All the earth made by God isholy; but the sea, which knows nothing of kings and priests andtyrants, is the holiest of all. Doctor! I should like to bury herin the sea. No mummeries, candles, incense, no holy water mumbledover by priests. The spirit of liberty is upon the waters.' . . .Amazing old man. He was saying all this in an undertone as iftalking to himself.""Yes, yes," interrupted Captain Mitchell, impatiently.  "Poor oldchap! But have you any idea how that ruffian Sotillo obtained hisinformation? He did not get hold of any of our Cargadores whohelped with the truck, did he? But no, it is impossible! Thesewere picked men we've had in our boats for these five years, andI paid them myself specially for the job, with instructions tokeep out of the way for twenty-four hours at least. I saw themwith my own eyes march on with the Italians to the railway yards.The chief promised to give them rations as long as they wanted toremain there.""Well," said the doctor, slowly, "I can tell you that you may saygood-bye for ever to your best lighter, and to the Capataz ofCargadores."At this, Captain Mitchell scrambled up to his feet in the excessof his excitement. The doctor, without giving him time toexclaim, stated briefly the part played by Hirsch during thenight.Captain Mitchell was overcome. "Drowned!" he muttered, in abewildered and appalled whisper.  "Drowned!" Afterwards he keptstill, apparently listening, but too absorbed in the news of thecatastrophe to follow the doctor's narrative with attention.The doctor had taken up an attitude of perfect ignorance, till atlast Sotillo was induced to have Hirsch brought in to repeat thewhole story, which was got out of him again with the greatestdifficulty, because every moment he would break out intolamentations.  At last, Hirsch was led away, looking more deadthan alive, and shut up in one of the upstairs rooms to be closeat hand. Then the doctor, keeping up his character of a man notadmitted to the inner councils of the San Tome Administration,remarked that the story sounded incredible. Of course, he said,he couldn't tell what had been the action of the Europeans, as hehad been exclusively occupied with his own work in looking afterthe wounded, and also in attending Don Jose Avellanos. He hadsucceeded in assuming so well a tone of impartial indifference,that Sotillo seemed to be completely deceived. Till then a showof regular inquiry had been kept up; one of the officers sittingat the table wrote down the questions and the answers, theothers, lounging about the room, listened attentively, puffing attheir long cigars and keeping their eyes on the doctor. But atthat point Sotillo ordered everybody out.CHAPTER THREEDIRECTLY they were alone, the colonel's severe official mannerchanged. He rose and approached the doctor.  His eyes shone withrapacity and hope; he became confidential.  "The silver mighthave been indeed put on board the lighter, but it was notconceivable that it should have been taken out to sea." Thedoctor, watching every word, nodded slightly, smoking withapparent relish the cigar which Sotillo had offered him as a signof his friendly intentions. The doctor's manner of colddetachment from the rest of the Europeans led Sotillo on, till,from conjecture to conjecture, he arrived at hinting that in hisopinion this was a putup job on the part of Charles Gould, inorder to get hold of that immense treasure all to himself. Thedoctor, observant and self-possessed, muttered, "He is verycapable of that."Here Captain Mitchell exclaimed with amazement, amusement, andindignation, "You said that of Charles Gould!" Disgust, and evensome suspicion, crept into his tone, for to him, too, as to otherEuropeans, there appeared to be something dubious about thedoctor's personality."What on earth made you say that to this watch-stealingscoundrel?" he asked. "What's the object of an infernal lie ofthat sort? That confounded pick-pocket was quite capable ofbelieving you."He snorted. For a time the doctor remained silent in the dark."Yes, that is exactly what I did say," he uttered at last, in atone which would have made it clear enough to a third party thatthe pause was not of a reluctant but of a reflective character.Captain Mitchell thought that he had never heard anything sobrazenly impudent in his life."Well, well!" he muttered to himself, but he had not the heart tovoice his thoughts. They were swept away by others full ofastonishment and regret. A heavy sense of discomfiture crushedhim: the loss of the silver, the death of Nostromo, which wasreally quite a blow to his sensibilities, because he had becomeattached to his Capataz as people get attached to their inferiorsfrom love of ease and almost unconscious gratitude.  And when hethought of Decoud being drowned, too, his sensibility was almostovercome by this miserable end.  What a heavy blow for that pooryoung woman! Captain Mitchell did not belong to the species ofcrabbed old bachelors; on the contrary, he liked to see young menpaying attentions to young women. It seemed to him a natural andproper thing. Proper especially.  As to sailors, it wasdifferent; it was not their place to marry, he maintained, but itwas on moral grounds as a matter of self-denial, for, heexplained, life on board ship is not fit for a woman even atbest, and if you leave her on shore, first of all it is not fair,and next she either suffers from it or doesn't care a bit, which,in both cases, is bad. He couldn't have told what upset himmost--Charles Gould's immense material loss, the death ofNostromo, which was a heavy loss to himself, or the idea of thatbeautiful and accomplished young woman being plunged intomourning."Yes," the doctor, who had been apparently reflecting, beganagain, "he believed me right enough.  I thought he would havehugged me. 'Si, si,' he said, 'he will write to that partner ofhis, the rich Americano in San Francisco, that it is all lost.Why not? There is enough to share with many people.'""But this is perfectly imbecile!" cried Captain Mitchell.The doctor remarked that Sotillo was imbecile, and that hisimbecility was ingenious enough to lead him completely astray. Hehad helped him only but a little way."I mentioned," the doctor said, "in a sort of casual way, thattreasure is generally buried in the earth rather than set afloatupon the sea. At this my Sotillo slapped his forehead. 'Por Dios,yes,' he said; 'they must have buried it on the shores of thisharbour somewhere before they sailed out.'""Heavens and earth!" muttered Captain Mitchell, "I should nothave believed that anybody could be ass enough--" He paused, thenwent on mournfully:  "But what's the good of all this? It wouldhave been a clever enough lie if the lighter had been stillafloat. It would have kept that inconceivable idiot perhaps fromsending out the steamer to cruise in the gulf. That was thedanger that worried me no end." Captain Mitchell sighedprofoundly."I had an object," the doctor pronounced, slowly."Had you?" muttered Captain Mitchell.  "Well, that's lucky, orelse I would have thought that you went on fooling him for thefun of the thing. And perhaps that was your object. Well, I mustsay I personally wouldn't condescend to that sort of thing. It isnot to my taste. No, no. Blackening a friend's character is notmy idea of fun, if it were to fool the greatest blackguard onearth."Had it not been for Captain Mitchell's depression, caused by thefatal news, his disgust of Dr. Monygham would have taken a moreoutspoken shape; but he thought to himself that now it really didnot matter what that man, whom he had never liked, would say anddo."I wonder," he grumbled, "why they have shut us up together, orwhy Sotillo should have shut you up at all, since it seems to meyou have been fairly chummy up there?""Yes, I wonder," said the doctor grimly.Captain Mitchell's heart was so heavy that he would havepreferred for the time being a complete solitude to the best ofcompany. But any company would have been preferable to thedoctor's, at whom he had always looked askance as a sort ofbeachcomber of superior intelligence partly reclaimed from hisabased state.  That feeling led him to ask--"What has that ruffian done with the other two?""The chief engineer he would have let go in any case," said thedoctor. "He wouldn't like to have a quarrel with the railway uponhis hands. Not just yet, at any rate. I don't think, CaptainMitchell, that you understand exactly what Sotillo's positionis--""I don't see why I should bother my head about it," snarledCaptain Mitchell."No," assented the doctor, with the same grim composure.  "Idon't see why you should. It wouldn't help a single human beingin the world if you thought ever so hard upon any subjectwhatever.""No," said Captain Mitchell, simply, and with evident depression."A man locked up in a confounded dark hole is not much use toanybody.""As to old Viola," the doctor continued, as though he had notheard, "Sotillo released him for the same reason he is presentlygoing to release you.""Eh? What?" exclaimed Captain Mitchell, staring like an owl inthe darkness. "What is there in common between me and old Viola?More likely because the old chap has no watch and chain for thepickpocket to steal. And I tell you what, Dr. Monygham," he wenton with rising choler, "he will find it more difficult than hethinks to get rid of me. He will burn his fingers over that jobyet, I can tell you. To begin with, I won't go without my watch,and as to the rest--we shall see. I dare say it is no greatmatter for you to be locked up.  But Joe Mitchell is a differentkind of man, sir. I don't mean to submit tamely to insult androbbery. I am a public character, sir."And then Captain Mitchell became aware that the bars of theopening had become visible, a black grating upon a square ofgrey. The coming of the day silenced Captain Mitchell as if bythe reflection that now in all the future days he would bedeprived of the invaluable services of his Capataz. He leanedagainst the wall with his arms folded on his breast, and thedoctor walked up and down the whole length of the place with hispeculiar hobbling gait, as if slinking about on damaged feet. Atthe end furthest from the grating he would be lost altogether inthe darkness. Only the slight limping shuffle could be heard.There was an air of moody detachment in that painful prowl keptup without a pause. When the door of the prison was suddenlyflung open and his name shouted out he showed no surprise. Heswerved sharply in his walk, and passed out at once, as thoughmuch depended upon his speed; but Captain Mitchell remained forsome time with his shoulders against the wall, quite undecided inthe bitterness of his spirit whether it wouldn't be better torefuse to stir a limb in the way of protest. He had half a mindto get himself carried out, but after the officer at the door hadshouted three or four times in tones of remonstrance and surprisehe condescended to walk out.Sotillo's manner had changed. The colonel's off-hand civility wasslightly irresolute, as though he were in doubt if civility werethe proper course in this case. He observed Captain Mitchellattentively before he spoke from the big armchair behind thetable in a condescending voice--"I have concluded not to detain you, Senor Mitchell.  I am of aforgiving disposition. I make allowances.  Let this be a lessonto you, however."The peculiar dawn of Sulaco, which seems to break far away to thewestward and creep back into the shade of the mountains, mingledwith the reddish light of the candles. Captain Mitchell, in signof contempt and indifference, let his eyes roam all over theroom, and he gave a hard stare to the doctor, perched already onthe casement of one of the windows, with his eyelids lowered,careless and thoughtful--or perhaps ashamed.Sotillo, ensconced in the vast armchair, remarked, "I should havethought that the feelings of a caballero would have dictated toyou an appropriate reply."He waited for it, but Captain Mitchell remaining mute, more fromextreme resentment than from reasoned intention, Sotillohesitated, glanced towards the doctor, who looked up and nodded,then went on with a slight effort--"Here, Senor Mitchell, is your watch. Learn how hasty and unjusthas been your judgment of my patriotic soldiers."Lying back in his seat, he extended his arm over the table andpushed the watch away slightly. Captain Mitchell walked up withundisguised eagerness, put it to his ear, then slipped it intohis pocket coolly.Sotillo seemed to overcome an immense reluctance.  Again helooked aside at the doctor, who stared at him unwinkingly.But as Captain Mitchell was turning away, without as much as anod or a glance, he hastened to say--"You may go and wait downstairs for the senor doctor, whom I amgoing to liberate, too. You foreigners are insignificant, to mymind."He forced a slight, discordant laugh out of himself, whileCaptain Mitchell, for the first time, looked at him with someinterest."The law shall take note later on of your transgressions,"Sotillo hurried on. "But as for me, you can live free, unguarded,unobserved. Do you hear, Senor Mitchell? You may depart to youraffairs. You are beneath my notice. My attention is claimed bymatters of the very highest importance."Captain Mitchell was very nearly provoked to an answer. Itdispleased him to be liberated insultingly; but want of sleep,prolonged anxieties, a profound disappointment with the fatalending of the silver-saving business weighed upon his spirits. Itwas as much as he could do to conceal his uneasiness, not abouthimself perhaps, but about things in general.  It occurred to himdistinctly that something underhand was going on. As he went outhe ignored the doctor pointedly."A brute!" said Sotillo, as the door shut.Dr. Monygham slipped off the window-sill, and, thrusting hishands into the pockets of the long, grey dust coat he waswearing, made a few steps into the room.Sotillo got up, too, and, putting himself in the way, examinedhim from head to foot."So your countrymen do not confide in you very much, senordoctor. They do not love you, eh? Why is that, I wonder?"The doctor, lifting his head, answered by a long, lifeless stareand the words, "Perhaps because I have lived too long inCostaguana."Sotillo had a gleam of white teeth under the black moustache."Aha! But you love yourself," he said, encouragingly."If you leave them alone," the doctor said, looking with the samelifeless stare at Sotillo's handsome face, "they will betraythemselves very soon. Meantime, I may try to make Don Carlosspeak?""Ah! senor doctor," said Sotillo, wagging his head, "you are aman of quick intelligence. We were made to understand eachother." He turned away. He could bear no longer thatexpressionless and motionless stare, which seemed to have a sortof impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss.Even in a man utterly devoid of moral sense there remains anappreciation of rascality which, being conventional, is perfectlyclear. Sotillo thought that Dr.  Monygham, so different from allEuropeans, was ready to sell his countrymen and Charles Gould,his employer, for some share of the San Tome silver. Sotillo didnot despise him for that. The colonel's want of moral sense wasof a profound and innocent character. It bordered upon stupidity,moral stupidity. Nothing that served his ends could appear to himreally reprehensible.  Nevertheless, he despised Dr. Monygham.He had for him an immense and satisfactory contempt.  He despisedhim with all his heart because he did not mean to let the doctorhave any reward at all. He despised him, not as a man withoutfaith and honour, but as a fool. Dr. Monygham's insight into hischaracter had deceived Sotillo completely. Therefore he thoughtthe doctor a fool.Since his arrival in Sulaco the colonel's ideas had undergonesome modification.He no longer wished for a political career in Montero'sadministration. He had always doubted the safety of that course.Since he had learned from the chief engineer that at daylightmost likely he would be confronted by Pedro Montero hismisgivings on that point had considerably increased. Theguerrillero brother of the general--the Pedrito of popularspeech--had a reputation of his own. He wasn't safe to deal with.Sotillo had vaguely planned seizing not only the treasure but thetown itself, and then negotiating at leisure.  But in the face offacts learned from the chief engineer (who had frankly disclosedto him the whole situation) his audacity, never of a very dashingkind, had been replaced by a most cautious hesitation."An army--an army crossed the mountains under Pedrito already,"he had repeated, unable to hide his consternation. "If it had notbeen that I am given the news by a man of your position I wouldnever have believed it. Astonishing!""An armed force," corrected the engineer, suavely.  His aim wasattained. It was to keep Sulaco clear of any armed occupation fora few hours longer, to let those whom fear impelled leave thetown. In the general dismay there were families hopeful enough tofly upon the road towards Los Hatos, which was left open by thewithdrawal of the armed rabble under Senores Fuentes and Gamacho,to Rincon, with their enthusiastic welcome for Pedro Montero. Itwas a hasty and risky exodus, and it was said that Hernandez,occupying with his band the woods about Los Hatos, was receivingthe fugitives. That a good many people he knew were contemplatingsuch a flight had been well known to the chief engineer.Father Corbelan's efforts in the cause of that most pious robberhad not been altogether fruitless. The political chief of Sulacohad yielded at the last moment to the urgent entreaties of thepriest, had signed a provisional nomination appointing Hernandeza general, and calling upon him officially in this new capacityto preserve order in the town. The fact is that the politicalchief, seeing the situation desperate, did not care what hesigned. It was the last official document he signed before heleft the palace of the Intendencia for the refuge of the O.S.N.Company's office. But even had he meant his act to be effectiveit was already too late. The riot which he feared and expectedbroke out in less than an hour after Father Corbelan had lefthim. Indeed, Father Corbelan, who had appointed a meeting withNostromo in the Dominican Convent, where he had his residence inone of the cells, never managed to reach the place. From theIntendencia he had gone straight on to the Avellanos's house totell his brother-in-law, and though he stayed there no more thanhalf an hour he had found himself cut off from his ascetic abode.Nostromo, after waiting there for some time, watching uneasilythe increasing uproar in the street, had made his way to theoffices of the Porvenir, and stayed there till daylight, asDecoud had mentioned in the letter to his sister. Thus theCapataz, instead of riding towards the Los Hatos woods as bearerof Hernandez's nomination, had remained in town to save the lifeof the President Dictator, to assist in repressing the outbreakof the mob, and at last to sail out with the silver of the mine.But Father Corbelan, escaping to Hernandez, had the document inhis pocket, a piece of official writing turning a bandit into ageneral in a memorable last official act of the Ribierist party,whose watchwords were honesty, peace, and progress. Probablyneither the priest nor the bandit saw the irony of it. FatherCorbelan must have found messengers to send into the town, forearly on the second day of the disturbances there were rumours ofHernandez being on the road to Los Hatos ready to receive thosewho would put themselves under his protection. A strange-lookinghorseman, elderly and audacious, had appeared in the town, ridingslowly while his eyes examined the fronts of the houses, asthough he had never seen such high buildings before.  Before thecathedral he had dismounted, and, kneeling in the middle of thePlaza, his bridle over his arm and his hat lying in front of himon the ground, had bowed his head, crossing himself and beatinghis breast for some little time. Remounting his horse, with afearless but not unfriendly look round the little gatheringformed about his public devotions, he had asked for the CasaAvellanos. A score of hands were extended in answer, with fingerspointing up the Calle de la Constitucion.The horseman had gone on with only a glance of casual curiosityupwards to the windows of the Amarilla Club at the corner. Hisstentorian voice shouted periodically in the empty street, "Whichis the Casa Avellanos?" till an answer came from the scaredporter, and he disappeared under the gate. The letter he wasbringing, written by Father Corbelan with a pencil by thecamp-fire of Hernandez, was addressed to Don Jose, of whosecritical state the priest was not aware. Antonia read it, and,after consulting Charles Gould, sent it on for the information ofthe gentlemen garrisoning the Amarilla Club. For herself, hermind was made up; she would rejoin her uncle; she would entrustthe last day--the last hours perhaps--of her father's life to thekeeping of the bandit, whose existence was a protest against theirresponsible tyranny of all parties alike, against the moraldarkness of the land. The gloom of Los Hatos woods waspreferable; a life of hardships in the train of a robber bandless debasing. Antonia embraced with all her soul her uncle'sobstinate defiance of misfortune. It was grounded in the beliefin the man whom she loved.In his message the Vicar-General answered upon his head forHernandez's fidelity. As to his power, he pointed out that he hadremained unsubdued for so many years. In that letter Decoud'sidea of the new Occidental State (whose flourishing and stablecondition is a matter of common knowledge now) was for the firsttime made public and used as an argument.  Hernandez, ex-banditand the last general of Ribierist creation, was confident ofbeing able to hold the tract of country between the woods of LosHatos and the coast range till that devoted patriot, Don MartinDecoud, could bring General Barrios back to Sulaco for thereconquest of the town."Heaven itself wills it. Providence is on our side," wrote FatherCorbelan; there was no time to reflect upon or to controvert hisstatement; and if the discussion started upon the reading of thatletter in the Amarilla Club was violent, it was also shortlived.In the general bewilderment of the collapse some jumped at theidea with joyful astonishment as upon the amazing discovery of anew hope. Others became fascinated by the prospect of immediatepersonal safety for their women and children. The majority caughtat it as a drowning man catches at a straw.   Father Corbelan wasunexpectedly offering them a refuge from Pedrito Montero with hisllaneros allied to Senores Fuentes and Gamacho with their armedrabble.All the latter part of the afternoon an animated discussion wenton in the big rooms of the Amarilla Club. Even those membersposted at the windows with rifles and carbines to guard the endof the street in case of an offensive return of the populaceshouted their opinions and arguments over their shoulders. Asdusk fell Don Juste Lopez, inviting those caballeros who were ofhis way of thinking to follow him, withdrew into the corredor,where at a little table in the light of two candles he busiedhimself in composing an address, or rather a solemn declarationto be presented to Pedrito Montero by a deputation of suchmembers of Assembly as had elected to remain in town. His ideawas to propitiate him in order to save the form at least ofparliamentary institutions. Seated before a blank sheet of paper,a goose-quill pen in his hand and surged upon from all sides, heturned to the right and to the left, repeating with solemninsistence--"Caballeros, a moment of silence! A moment of silence! We oughtto make it clear that we bow in all good faith to theaccomplished facts."The utterance of that phrase seemed to give him a melancholysatisfaction. The hubbub of voices round him was growing strainedand hoarse. In the sudden pauses the excited grimacing of thefaces would sink all at once into the stillness of profounddejection.Meantime, the exodus had begun. Carretas full of ladies andchildren rolled swaying across the Plaza, with men walking orriding by their side; mounted parties followed on mules andhorses; the poorest were setting out on foot, men and womencarrying bundles, clasping babies in their arms, leading oldpeople, dragging along the bigger children. When Charles Gould,after leaving the doctor and the engineer at the Casa Viola,entered the town by the harbour gate, all those that had meant togo were gone, and the others had barricaded themselves in theirhouses. In the whole dark street there was only one spot offlickering lights and moving figures, where the SenorAdministrador recognized his wife's carriage waiting at the doorof the Avellanos's house.  He rode up, almost unnoticed, andlooked on without a word while some of his own servants came outof the gate carrying Don Jose Avellanos, who, with closed eyesand motionless features, appeared perfectly lifeless.  His wifeand Antonia walked on each side of the improvised stretcher,which was put at once into the carriage. The two women embraced;while from the other side of the landau Father Corbelan'semissary, with his ragged beard all streaked with grey, and high,bronzed cheek-bones, stared, sitting upright in the saddle. ThenAntonia, dry-eyed, got in by the side of the stretcher, and,after making the sign of the cross rapidly, lowered a thick veilupon her face. The servants and the three or four neighbours whohad come to assist, stood back, uncovering their heads. On thebox, Ignacio, resigned now to driving all night (and to havingperhaps his throat cut before daylight) looked back surlily overhis shoulder."Drive carefully," cried Mrs. Gould in a tremulous voice."Si, carefully; si nina," he mumbled, chewing his lips, his roundleathery cheeks quivering. And the landau rolled slowly out ofthe light."I will see them as far as the ford," said Charles Gould to hiswife. She stood on the edge of the sidewalk with her handsclasped lightly, and nodded to him as he followed after thecarriage. And now the windows of the Amarilla Club were dark. Thelast spark of resistance had died out. Turning his head at thecorner, Charles Gould saw his wife crossing over to their owngate in the lighted patch of the street. One of their neighbours,a well-known merchant and landowner of the province, followed ather elbow, talking with great gestures. As she passed in all thelights went out in the street, which remained dark and empty fromend to end.The houses of the vast Plaza were lost in the night.  High up,like a star, there was a small gleam in one of the towers of thecathedral; and the equestrian statue gleamed pale against theblack trees of the Alameda, like a ghost of royalty haunting thescenes of revolution.  The rare prowlers they met rangedthemselves against the wall. Beyond the last houses the carriagerolled noiselessly on the soft cushion of dust, and with agreater obscurity a feeling of freshness seemed to fall from thefoliage of the trees bordering the country road.  The emissaryfrom Hernandez's camp pushed his horse close to Charles Gould."Caballero," he said in an interested voice, "you are he whomthey call the King of Sulaco, the master of the mine? Is it notso?""Yes, I am the master of the mine," answered Charles Gould.The man cantered for a time in silence, then said, "I have abrother, a sereno in your service in the San Tome valley. Youhave proved yourself a just man.  There has been no wrong done toany one since you called upon the people to work in themountains. My brother says that no official of the Government, nooppressor of the Campo, has been seen on your side of the stream.Your own officials do not oppress the people in the gorge.Doubtless they are afraid of your severity. You are a just manand a powerful one," he added.He spoke in an abrupt, independent tone, but evidently he wascommunicative with a purpose. He told Charles Gould that he hadbeen a ranchero in one of the lower valleys, far south, aneighbour of Hernandez in the old days, and godfather to hiseldest boy; one of those who joined him in his resistance to therecruiting raid which was the beginning of all their misfortunes.It was he that, when his compadre had been carried off, hadburied his wife and children, murdered by the soldiers."Si, senor," he muttered, hoarsely, "I and two or three others,the lucky ones left at liberty, buried them all in one grave nearthe ashes of their ranch, under the tree that had shaded itsroof."It was to him, too, that Hernandez came after he had deserted,three years afterwards. He had still his uniform on with thesergeant's stripes on the sleeve, and the blood of his colonelupon his hands and breast.  Three troopers followed him, of thosewho had started in pursuit but had ridden on for liberty. And hetold Charles Gould how he and a few friends, seeing thosesoldiers, lay in ambush behind some rocks ready to pull thetrigger on them, when he recognized his compadre and jumped upfrom cover, shouting his name, because he knew that Hernandezcould not have been coming back on an errand of injustice andoppression. Those three soldiers, together with the party who laybehind the rocks, had formed the nucleus of the famous band, andhe, the narrator, had been the favourite lieutenant of Hernandezfor many, many years. He mentioned proudly that the officials hadput a price upon his head, too; but it did not prevent it gettingsprinkled with grey upon his shoulders. And now he had lived longenough to see his compadre made a general.He had a burst of muffled laughter. "And now from robbers we havebecome soldiers. But look, Caballero, at those who made ussoldiers and him a general! Look at these people!"Ignacio shouted. The light of the carriage lamps, running alongthe nopal hedges that crowned the bank on each side, flashed uponthe scared faces of people standing aside in the road, sunk deep,like an English country lane, into the soft soil of the Campo.They cowered; their eyes glistened very big for a second; andthen the light, running on, fell upon the half-denuded roots of abig tree, on another stretch of nopal hedge, caught up anotherbunch of faces glaring back apprehensively.  Three women--of whomone was carrying a child--and a couple of men in civiliandress--one armed with a sabre and another with a gun--weregrouped about a donkey carrying two bundles tied up in blankets.Further on Ignacio shouted again to pass a carreta, a long woodenbox on two high wheels, with the door at the back swinging open.Some ladies in it must have recognized the white mules, becausethey screamed out, "Is it you, Dona Emilia?"At the turn of the road the glare of a big fire filled the shortstretch vaulted over by the branches meeting overhead.  Near theford of a shallow stream a roadside rancho of woven rushes and aroof of grass had been set on fire by accident, and the flames,roaring viciously, lit up an open space blocked with horses,mules, and a distracted, shouting crowd of people. When Ignaciopulled up, several ladies on foot assailed the carriage, beggingAntonia for a seat. To their clamour she answered by pointingsilently to her father."I must leave you here," said Charles Gould, in the uproar. Theflames leaped up sky-high, and in the recoil from the scorchingheat across the road the stream of fugitives pressed against thecarriage. A middle-aged lady dressed in black silk, but with acoarse manta over her head and a rough branch for a stick in herhand, staggered against the front wheel. Two young girls,frightened and silent, were clinging to her arms. Charles Gouldknew her very well."Misericordia! We are getting terribly bruised in this crowd!"she exclaimed, smiling up courageously to him. "We have startedon foot. All our servants ran away yesterday to join thedemocrats. We are going to put ourselves under the protection ofFather Corbelan, of your sainted uncle, Antonia. He has wrought amiracle in the heart of a most merciless robber. A miracle!"She raised her voice gradually up to a scream as she was bornealong by the pressure of people getting out of the way of somecarts coming up out of the ford at a gallop, with loud yells andcracking of whips. Great masses of sparks mingled with blacksmoke flew over the road; the bamboos of the walls detonated inthe fire with the sound of an irregular fusillade. And then thebright blaze sank suddenly, leaving only a red dusk crowded withaimless dark shadows drifting in contrary directions; the noiseof voices seemed to die away with the flame; and the tumult ofheads, arms, quarrelling, and imprecations passed on fleeing intothe darkness."I must leave you now," repeated Charles Gould to Antonia. Sheturned her head slowly and uncovered her face. The emissary andcompadre of Hernandez spurred his horse close up."Has not the master of the mine any message to send to Hernandez,the master of the Campo?"The truth of the comparison struck Charles Gould heavily. In hisdetermined purpose he held the mine, and the indomitable banditheld the Campo by the same precarious tenure. They were equalsbefore the lawlessness of the land. It was impossible todisentangle one's activity from its debasing contacts. Aclose-meshed net of crime and corruption lay upon the wholecountry. An immense and weary discouragement sealed his lips fora time."You are a just man," urged the emissary of Hernandez.  "Look atthose people who made my compadre a general and have turned usall into soldiers.  Look at those oligarchs fleeing for life,with only the clothes on their backs. My compadre does not thinkof that, but our followers may be wondering greatly, and I wouldspeak for them to you. Listen, senor! For many months now theCampo has been our own. We need ask no man for anything; butsoldiers must have their pay to live honestly when the wars areover. It is believed that your soul is so just that a prayer fromyou would cure the sickness of every beast, like the orison ofthe upright judge. Let me have some words from your lips thatwould act like a charm upon the doubts of our partida, where allare men.""Do you hear what he says?" Charles Gould said in English toAntonia."Forgive us our misery!" she exclaimed, hurriedly.  "It is yourcharacter that is the inexhaustible treasure which may save usall yet; your character, Carlos, not your wealth. I entreat youto give this man your word that you will accept any arrangementmy uncle may make with their chief. One word. He will want nomore."On the site of the roadside hut there remained nothing but anenormous heap of embers, throwing afar a darkening red glow, inwhich Antonia's face appeared deeply flushed with excitement.Charles Gould, with only a short hesitation, pronounced therequired pledge.  He was like a man who had ventured on aprecipitous path with no room to turn, where the only chance ofsafety is to press forward. At that moment he understood itthoroughly as he looked down at Don Jose stretched out, hardlybreathing, by the side of the erect Antonia, vanquished in alifelong struggle with the powers of moral darkness, whosestagnant depths breed monstrous crimes and monstrous illusions.In a few words the emissary from Hernandez expressed his completesatisfaction. Stoically Antonia lowered her veil, resisting thelonging to inquire about Decoud's escape.  But Ignacio leeredmorosely over his shoulder."Take a good look at the mules, mi amo," he grumbled.  "You shallnever see them again!"CHAPTER FOURCHARLES GOULD turned towards the town. Before him the jaggedpeaks of the Sierra came out all black in the clear dawn. Hereand there a muffled lepero whisked round the corner of agrass-grown street before the ringing hoofs of his horse. Dogsbarked behind the walls of the gardens; and with the colourlesslight the chill of the snows seemed to fall from the mountainsupon the disjointed pavements and the shuttered houses withbroken cornices and the plaster peeling in patches between theflat pilasters of the fronts. The daybreak struggled with thegloom under the arcades on the Plaza, with no signs of countrypeople disposing their goods for the day's market, piles offruit, bundles of vegetables ornamented with flowers, on lowbenches under enormous mat umbrellas; with no cheery earlymorning bustle of villagers, women, children, and loaded donkeys.Only a few scattered knots of revolutionists stood in the vastspace, all looking one way from under their slouched hats forsome sign of news from Rincon.  The largest of those groupsturned about like one man as Charles Gould passed, and shouted,"Viva la libertad!" after him in a menacing tone.Charles Gould rode on, and turned into the archway of his house.In the patio littered with straw, a practicante, one of Dr.Monygham's native assistants, sat on the ground with his backagainst the rim of the fountain, fingering a guitar discreetly,while two girls of the lower class, standing up before him,shuffled their feet a little and waved their arms, humming apopular dance tune.Most of the wounded during the two days of rioting had been takenaway already by their friends and relations, but several figurescould be seen sitting up balancing their bandaged heads in timeto the music. Charles Gould dismounted. A sleepy mozo coming outof the bakery door took hold of the horse's bridle; thepracticante endeavoured to conceal his guitar hastily; the girls,unabashed, stepped back smiling; and Charles Gould, on his way tothe staircase, glanced into a dark corner of the patio at anothergroup, a mortally wounded Cargador with a woman kneeling by hisside; she mumbled prayers rapidly, trying at the same time toforce a piece of orange between the stiffening lips of the dyingman.The cruel futility of things stood unveiled in the levity andsufferings of that incorrigible people; the cruel futility oflives and of deaths thrown away in the vain endeavour to attainan enduring solution of the problem.  Unlike Decoud, CharlesGould could not play lightly a part in a tragic farce. It wastragic enough for him in all conscience, but he could see nofarcical element.  He suffered too much under a conviction ofirremediable folly. He was too severely practical and tooidealistic to look upon its terrible humours with amusement, asMartin Decoud, the imaginative materialist, was able to do in thedry light of his scepticism.  To him, as to all of us, thecompromises with his conscience appeared uglier than ever in thelight of failure.  His taciturnity, assumed with a purpose, hadprevented him from tampering openly with his thoughts; but theGould Concession had insidiously corrupted his judgment.  Hemight have known, he said to himself, leaning over the balustradeof the corredor, that Ribierism could never come to anything. Themine had corrupted his judgment by making him sick of bribing andintriguing merely to have his work left alone from day to day.Like his father, he did not like to be robbed.  It exasperatedhim. He had persuaded himself that, apart from higherconsiderations, the backing up of Don Jose's hopes of reform wasgood business. He had gone forth into the senseless fray as hispoor uncle, whose sword hung on the wall of his study, had goneforth--in the defence of the commonest decencies of organizedsociety. Only his weapon was the wealth of the mine, morefar-reaching and subtle than an honest blade of steel fitted intoa simple brass guard.More dangerous to the wielder, too, this weapon of wealth,double-edged with the cupidity and misery of mankind, steeped inall the vices of self-indulgence as in a concoction of poisonousroots, tainting the very cause for which it is drawn, alwaysready to turn awkwardly in the hand. There was nothing for it nowbut to go on using it. But he promised himself to see itshattered into small bits before he let it be wrenched from hisgrasp.After all, with his English parentage and English upbringing, heperceived that he was an adventurer in Costaguana, the descendantof adventurers enlisted in a foreign legion, of men who hadsought fortune in a revolutionary war, who had plannedrevolutions, who had believed in revolutions. For all theuprightness of his character, he had something of an adventurer'seasy morality which takes count of personal risk in the ethicalappraising of his action. He was prepared, if need be, to blow upthe whole San Tome mountain sky high out of the territory of theRepublic. This resolution expressed the tenacity of hischaracter, the remorse of that subtle conjugal infidelity throughwhich his wife was no longer the sole mistress of his thoughts,something of his father's imaginative weakness, and something,too, of the spirit of a buccaneer throwing a lighted match intothe magazine rather than surrender his ship.Down below in the patio the wounded Cargador had breathed hislast. The woman cried out once, and her cry, unexpected andshrill, made all the wounded sit up. The practicante scrambled tohis feet, and, guitar in hand, gazed steadily in her directionwith elevated eyebrows. The two girls--sitting now one on eachside of their wounded relative, with their knees drawn up andlong cigars between their lips--nodded at each othersignificantly.Charles Gould, looking down over the balustrade, saw three mendressed ceremoniously in black frock-coats with white shirts, andwearing European round hats, enter the patio from the street. Oneof them, head and shoulders taller than the two others, advancedwith marked gravity, leading the way. This was Don Juste Lopez,accompanied by two of his friends, members of Assembly, coming tocall upon the Administrador of the San Tome mine at this earlyhour. They saw him, too, waved their hands to him urgently,walking up the stairs as if in procession.Don Juste, astonishingly changed by having shaved off altogetherhis damaged beard, had lost with it ninetenths of his outwarddignity. Even at that time of serious pre-occupation CharlesGould could not help noting the revealed ineptitude in the aspectof the man.  His companions looked crestfallen and sleepy. Onekept on passing the tip of his tongue over his parched lips; theother's eyes strayed dully over the tiled floor of the corredor,while Don Juste, standing a little in advance, harangued theSenor Administrador of the San Tome mine. It was his firm opinionthat forms had to be observed. A new governor is always visitedby deputations from the Cabildo, which is the Municipal Council,from the Consulado, the commercial Board, and it was proper thatthe Provincial Assembly should send a deputation, too, if only toassert the existence of parliamentary institutions. Don Justeproposed that Don Carlos Gould, as the most prominent citizen ofthe province, should join the Assembly's deputation. His positionwas exceptional, his personality known through the length andbreadth of the whole Republic. Official courtesies must not beneglected, if they are gone through with a bleeding heart. Theacceptance of accomplished facts may save yet the preciousvestiges of parliamentary institutions. Don Juste's eyes gloweddully; he believed in parliamentary institutions--and theconvinced drone of his voice lost itself in the stillness of thehouse like the deep buzzing of some ponderous insect.Charles Gould had turned round to listen patiently, leaning hiselbow on the balustrade. He shook his head a little, refusing,almost touched by the anxious gaze of the President of theProvincial Assembly. It was not Charles Gould's policy to makethe San Tome mine a party to any formal proceedings."My advice, senores, is that you should wait for your fate inyour houses. There is no necessity for you to give yourselves upformally into Montero's hands.  Submission to the inevitable, asDon Juste calls it, is all very well, but when the inevitable iscalled Pedrito Montero there is no need to exhibit pointedly thewhole extent of your surrender. The fault of this country is thewant of measure in political life. Flat acquiescence inillegality, followed by sanguinary reaction--that, senores, isnot the way to a stable and prosperous future."Charles Gould stopped before the sad bewilderment of the faces,the wondering, anxious glances of the eyes.  The feeling of pityfor those men, putting all their trust into words of some sort,while murder and rapine stalked over the land, had betrayed himinto what seemed empty loquacity. Don Juste murmured--"You are abandoning us, Don Carlos. . . . And yet, parliamentaryinstitutions--"He could not finish from grief. For a moment he put his hand overhis eyes. Charles Gould, in his fear of empty loquacity, made noanswer to the charge. He returned in silence their ceremoniousbows. His taciturnity was his refuge. He understood that whatthey sought was to get the influence of the San Tome mine ontheir side. They wanted to go on a conciliating errand to thevictor under the wing of the Gould Concession.  Other publicbodies--the Cabildo, the Consulado--would be coming, too,presently, seeking the support of the most stable, the mosteffective force they had ever known to exist in their province.The doctor, arriving with his sharp, jerky walk, found that themaster had retired into his own room with.  orders not to bedisturbed on any account. But Dr.  Monygham was not anxious tosee Charles Gould at once. He spent some time in a rapidexamination of his wounded. He gazed down upon each in turn,rubbing his chin between his thumb and forefinger; his steadystare met without expression their silently inquisitive look. Allthese cases were doing well; but when he came to the deadCargador he stopped a little longer, surveying not the man whohad ceased to suffer, but the woman kneeling in silentcontemplation of the rigid face, with its pinched nostrils and awhite gleam in the imperfectly closed eyes. She lifted her headslowly, and said in a dull voice--"It is not long since he had become a Cargador--only a few weeks.His worship the Capataz had accepted him after many entreaties.""I am not responsible for the great Capataz," muttered thedoctor, moving off.Directing his course upstairs towards the door of Charles Gould'sroom, the doctor at the last moment hesitated; then, turning awayfrom the handle with a shrug of his uneven shoulders, slunk offhastily along the corredor in search of Mrs. Gould's camerista.Leonardo told him that the senora had not risen yet.  The senorahad given into her charge the girls belonging to that Italianposadero. She, Leonarda, had put them to bed in her own room. Thefair girl had cried herself to sleep, but the dark one--thebigger--had not closed her eyes yet. She sat up in bed clutchingthe sheets right up under her chin and staring before her like alittle witch. Leonarda did not approve of the Viola childrenbeing admitted to the house. She made this feeling clear by theindifferent tone in which she inquired whether their mother wasdead yet. As to the senora, she must be asleep. Ever since shehad gone into her room after seeing the departure of Dona Antoniawith her dying father, there had been no sound behind her door.The doctor, rousing himself out of profound reflection, told herabruptly to call her mistress at once. He hobbled off to wait forMrs. Gould in the sala. He was very tired, but too excited to sitdown. In this great drawing-room, now empty, in which hiswithered soul had been refreshed after many arid years and hisoutcast spirit had accepted silently the toleration of manyside-glances, he wandered haphazard amongst the chairs and tablestill Mrs. Gould, enveloped in a morning wrapper, came in rapidly."You know that I never approved of the silver being sent away,"the doctor began at once, as a preliminary to the narrative ofhis night's adventures in association with Captain Mitchell, theengineer-in-chief, and old Viola, at Sotillo's headquarters. Tothe doctor, with his special conception of this political crisis,the removal of the silver had seemed an irrational and ill-omenedmeasure. It was as if a general were sending the best part of histroops away on the eve of battle upon some recondite pretext. Thewhole lot of ingots might have been concealed somewhere wherethey could have been got at for the purpose of staving off thedangers which were menacing the security of the Gould Concession.The Administrador had acted as if the immense and powerfulprosperity of the mine had been founded on methods of probity, onthe sense of usefulness. And it was nothing of the kind. Themethod followed had been the only one possible. The GouldConcession had ransomed its way through all those years. It was anauseous process. He quite understood that Charles Gould had gotsick of it and had left the old path to back up that hopelessattempt at reform. The doctor did not believe in the reform ofCostaguana. And now the mine was back again in its old path, withthe disadvantage that henceforth it had to deal not only with thegreed provoked by its wealth, but with the resentment awakened bythe attempt to free itself from its bondage to moral corruption.That was the penalty of failure. What made him uneasy was thatCharles Gould seemed to him to have weakened at the decisivemoment when a frank return to the old methods was the onlychance. Listening to Decoud's wild scheme had been a weakness.The doctor flung up his arms, exclaiming, "Decoud!  Decoud!" Hehobbled about the room with slight, angry laughs. Many years agoboth his ankles had been seriously damaged in the course of acertain investigation conducted in the castle of Sta. Marta by acommission composed of military men. Their nomination had beensignified to them unexpectedly at the dead of night, withscowling brow, flashing eyes, and in a tempestuous voice, byGuzman Bento. The old tyrant, maddened by one of his suddenaccesses of suspicion, mingled spluttering appeals to theirfidelity with imprecations and horrible menaces. The cells andcasements of the castle on the hill had been already filled withprisoners. The commission was charged now with the task ofdiscovering the iniquitous conspiracy against the Citizen-Saviourof his country.Their dread of the raving tyrant translated itself into a hastyferocity of procedure. The Citizen-Saviour was not accustomed towait. A conspiracy had to be discovered.  The courtyards of thecastle resounded with the clanking of leg-irons, sounds of blows,yells of pain; and the commission of high officers labouredfeverishly, concealing their distress and apprehensions from eachother, and especially from their secretary, Father Beron, an armychaplain, at that time very much in the confidence of theCitizen-Saviour. That priest was a big round-shouldered man, withan unclean-looking, overgrown tonsure on the top of his flathead, of a dingy, yellow complexion, softly fat, with greasystains all down the front of his lieutenant's uniform, and asmall cross embroidered in white cotton on his left breast. Hehad a heavy nose and a pendant lip. Dr. Monygham remembered himstill. He remembered him against all the force of his willstriving its utmost to forget. Father Beron had been adjoined tothe commission by Guzman Bento expressly for the purpose that hisenlightened zeal should assist them in their labours. Dr.Monygham could by no manner of means forget the zeal of FatherBeron, or his face, or the pitiless, monotonous voice in which hepronounced the words, "Will you confess now?"This memory did not make him shudder, but it had made of him whathe was in the eyes of respectable people, a man careless ofcommon decencies, something between a clever vagabond and adisreputable doctor.  But not all respectable people would havehad the necessary delicacy of sentiment to understand with whattrouble of mind and accuracy of vision Dr. Monygham, medicalofficer of the San Tome mine, remembered Father Beron, armychaplain, and once a secretary of a military commission. Afterall these years Dr.  Monygham, in his rooms at the end of thehospital building in the San Tome gorge, remembered Father Beronas distinctly as ever. He remembered that priest at night,sometimes, in his sleep. On such nights the doctor waited fordaylight with a candle lighted, and walking the whole length ofhis rooms to and fro, staring down at his bare feet, his armshugging his sides tightly. He would dream of Father Beron sittingat the end of a long black table, behind which, in a row,appeared the heads, shoulders, and epaulettes of the militarymembers, nibbling the feather of a quill pen, and listening withweary and impatient scorn to the protestations of some prisonercalling heaven to witness of his innocence, till he burst out,"What's the use of wasting time over that miserable nonsense! Letme take him outside for a while." And Father Beron would gooutside after the clanking prisoner, led away between twosoldiers. Such interludes happened on many days, many times, withmany prisoners. When the prisoner returned he was ready to make afull confession, Father Beron would declare, leaning forward withthat dull, surfeited look which can be seen in the eyes ofgluttonous persons after a heavy meal.The priest's inquisitorial instincts suffered but little from thewant of classical apparatus of the Inquisition At no time of theworld's history have men been at a loss how to inflict mental andbodily anguish upon their fellow-creatures. This aptitude came tothem in the growing complexity of their passions and the earlyrefinement of their ingenuity. But it may safely be said thatprimeval man did not go to the trouble of inventing tortures. Hewas indolent and pure of heart. He brained his neighbourferociously with a stone axe from necessity and without malice.The stupidest mind may invent a rankling phrase or brand theinnocent with a cruel aspersion. A piece of string and a ramrod;a few muskets in combination with a length of hide rope; or evena simple mallet of heavy, hard wood applied with a swing to humanfingers or to the joints of a human body is enough for theinfliction of the most exquisite torture. The doctor had been avery stubborn prisoner, and, as a natural consequence of that"bad disposition" (so Father Beron called it), his subjugationhad been very crushing and very complete. That is why the limp inhis walk, the twist of his shoulders, the scars on his cheekswere so pronounced. His confessions, when they came at last, werevery complete, too. Sometimes on the nights when he walked thefloor, he wondered, grinding his teeth with shame and rage, atthe fertility of his imagination when stimulated by a sort ofpain which makes truth, honour, selfrespect, and life itselfmatters of little moment.And he could not forget Father Beron with his monotonous phrase,"Will you confess now?" reaching him in an awful iteration andlucidity of meaning through the delirious incoherence ofunbearable pain. He could not forget. But that was not the worst.Had he met Father Beron in the street after all these years Dr.Monygham was sure he would have quailed before him.  Thiscontingency was not to be feared now. Father Beron was dead; butthe sickening certitude prevented Dr. Monygham from lookinganybody in the face.Dr. Monygham. had become, in a manner, the slave of a ghost. Itwas obviously impossible to take his knowledge of Father Beronhome to Europe. When making his extorted confessions to theMilitary Board, Dr.  Monygham was not seeking to avoid death. Helonged for it. Sitting half-naked for hours on the wet earth ofhis prison, and so motionless that the spiders, his companions,attached their webs to his matted hair, he consoled the misery ofhis soul with acute reasonings that he had confessed to crimesenough for a sentence of death--that they had gone too far withhim to let him live to tell the tale.But, as if by a refinement of cruelty, Dr. Monygham was left formonths to decay slowly in the darkness of his grave-like prison.It was no doubt hoped that it would finish him off without thetrouble of an execution; but Dr. Monygham had an ironconstitution. It was Guzman Bento who died, not by the knifethrust of a conspirator, but from a stroke of apoplexy, and Dr.Monygham was liberated hastily. His fetters were struck off bythe light of a candle, which, after months of gloom, hurt hiseyes so much that he had to cover his face with his hands. He wasraised up. His heart was beating violently with the fear of thisliberty. When he tried to walk the extraordinary lightness of hisfeet made him giddy, and he fell down. Two sticks were thrustinto his hands, and he was pushed out of the passage. It wasdusk; candles glimmered already in the windows of the officers'quarters round the courtyard; but the twilight sky dazed him byits enormous and overwhelming brilliance. A thin poncho hung overhis naked, bony shoulders; the rags of his trousers came down nolower than his knees; an eighteen months' growth of hair fell indirty grey locks on each side of his sharp cheek-bones. As hedragged himself past the guard-room door, one of the soldiers,lolling outside, moved by some obscure impulse, leaped forwardwith a strange laugh and rammed a broken old straw hat on hishead. And Dr. Monygham, after having tottered, continued on hisway. He advanced one stick, then one maimed foot, then the otherstick; the other foot followed only a very short distance alongthe ground, toilfully, as though it were almost too heavy to bemoved at all; and yet his legs under the hanging angles of theponcho appeared no thicker than the two sticks in his hands. Aceaseless trembling agitated his bent body, all his wasted limbs,his bony head, the conical, ragged crown of the sombrero, whoseample flat rim rested on his shoulders.In such conditions of manner and attire did Dr.  Monygham goforth to take possession of his liberty.  And these conditionsseemed to bind him indissolubly to the land of Costaguana like anawful procedure of naturalization, involving him deep in thenational life, far deeper than any amount of success and honourcould have done. They did away with his Europeanism; for Dr.Monygham had made himself an ideal conception of his disgrace. Itwas a conception eminently fit and proper for an officer and agentleman. Dr. Monygham, before he went out to Costaguana, hadbeen surgeon in one of Her Majesty's regiments of foot. It was aconception which took no account of physiological facts orreasonable arguments; but it was not stupid for all that.  It wassimple. A rule of conduct resting mainly on severe rejections isnecessarily simple.  Dr. Monygham's view of what it behoved himto do was severe; it was an ideal view, in so much that it wasthe imaginative exaggeration of a correct feeling. It was also,in its force, influence, and persistency, the view of aneminently loyal nature.There was a great fund of loyalty in Dr. Monygham's nature. Hehad settled it all on Mrs. Gould's head. He believed her worthyof every devotion. At the bottom of his heart he felt an angryuneasiness before the prosperity of the San Tome mine, becauseits growth was robbing her of all peace of mind. Costaguana wasno place for a woman of that kind. What could Charles Gould havebeen thinking of when he brought her out there! It wasoutrageous! And the doctor had watched the course of events witha grim and distant reserve which, he imagined, his lamentablehistory imposed upon him.Loyalty to Mrs. Gould could not, however, leave out of accountthe safety of her husband. The doctor had contrived to be in townat the critical time because he mistrusted Charles Gould. Heconsidered him hopelessly infected with the madness ofrevolutions. That is why he hobbled in distress in thedrawing-room of the Casa Gould on that morning, exclaiming,"Decoud, Decoud!" in a tone of mournful irritation.Mrs. Gould, her colour heightened, and with glistening eyes,looked straight before her at the sudden enormity of thatdisaster. The finger-tips on one hand rested lightly on a lowlittle table by her side, and the arm trembled right up to theshoulder. The sun, which looks late upon Sulaco, issuing in allthe fulness of its power high up on the sky from behind thedazzling snow-edge of Higuerota, had precipitated the delicate,smooth, pearly greyness of light, in which the town lies steepedduring the early hours, into sharp-cut masses of black shade andspaces of hot, blinding glare. Three long rectangles of sunshinefell through the windows of the sala; while just across thestreet the front of the Avellanos's house appeared very sombre inits own shadow seen through the flood of light.A voice said at the door, "What of Decoud?"It was Charles Gould. They had not heard him coming along thecorredor. His glance just glided over his wife and struck full atthe doctor."You have brought some news, doctor?"Dr. Monygham blurted it all out at once, in the rough.  For sometime after he had done, the Administrador of the San Tome mineremained looking at him without a word. Mrs. Gould sank into alow chair with her hands lying on her lap. A silence reignedbetween those three motionless persons. Then Charles Gouldspoke--"You must want some breakfast."He stood aside to let his wife pass first. She caught up herhusband's hand and pressed it as she went out, raising herhandkerchief to her eyes. The sight of her husband had broughtAntonia's position to her mind, and she could not contain hertears at the thought of the poor girl. When she rejoined the twomen in the diningroom after having bathed her face, Charles Gouldwas saying to the doctor across the table--"No, there does not seem any room for doubt."And the doctor assented."No, I don't see myself how we could question that wretchedHirsch's tale. It's only too true, I fear."She sat down desolately at the head of the table and looked fromone to the other. The two men, without absolutely turning theirheads away, tried to avoid her glance. The doctor even made ashow of being hungry; he seized his knife and fork, and began toeat with emphasis, as if on the stage. Charles Gould made nopretence of the sort; with his elbows raised squarely, he twistedboth ends of his flaming moustaches--they were so long that hishands were quite away from his face."I am not surprised," he muttered, abandoning his moustaches andthrowing one arm over the back of his chair. His face was calmwith that immobility of expression which betrays the intensity ofa mental struggle. He felt that this accident had brought to apoint all the consequences involved in his line of conduct, withits conscious and subconscious intentions.  There must be an endnow of this silent reserve, of that air of impenetrability behindwhich he had been safeguarding his dignity. It was the leastignoble form of dissembling forced upon him by that parody ofcivilized institutions which offended his intelligence, hisuprightness, and his sense of right. He was like his father.  Hehad no ironic eye. He was not amused at the absurdities thatprevail in this world. They hurt him in his innate gravity. Hefelt that the miserable death of that poor Decoud took from himhis inaccessible position of a force in the background. Itcommitted him openly unless he wished to throw up the game--andthat was impossible. The material interests required from him thesacrifice of his aloofness--perhaps his own safety too. And hereflected that Decoud's separationist plan had not gone to thebottom with the lost silver.The only thing that was not changed was his position towards Mr.Holroyd. The head of silver and steel interests had entered intoCostaguana affairs with a sort of passion. Costaguana had becomenecessary to his existence; in the San Tome mine he had found theimaginative satisfaction which other minds would get from drama,from art, or from a risky and fascinating sport.  It was aspecial form of the great man's extravagance, sanctioned by amoral intention, big enough to flatter his vanity. Even in thisaberration of his genius he served the progress of the world.Charles Gould felt sure of being understood with precision andjudged with the indulgence of their common passion.  Nothing nowcould surprise or startle this great man.  And Charles Gouldimagined himself writing a letter to San Francisco in some suchwords: ". . . . The men at the head of the movement are dead orhave fled; the civil organization of the province is at an endfor the present; the Blanco party in Sulaco has collapsedinexcusably, but in the characteristic manner of this country.But Barrios, untouched in Cayta, remains still available. I amforced to take up openly the plan of a provincial revolution asthe only way of placing the enormous material interests involvedin the prosperity and peace of Sulaco in a position of permanentsafety. . . ." That was clear. He saw these words as if writtenin letters of fire upon the wall at which he was gazingabstractedly.Mrs Gould watched his abstraction with dread. It was a domesticand frightful phenomenon that darkened and chilled the house forher like a thundercloud passing over the sun. Charles Gould'sfits of abstraction depicted the energetic concentration of awill haunted by a fixed idea. A man haunted by a fixed idea isinsane. He is dangerous even if that idea is an idea of justice;for may he not bring the heaven down pitilessly upon a lovedhead? The eyes of Mrs. Gould, watching her husband's profile,filled with tears again. And again she seemed to see the despairof the unfortunate Antonia."What would I have done if Charley had been drowned while we wereengaged?" she exclaimed, mentally, with horror. Her heart turnedto ice, while her cheeks flamed up as if scorched by the blaze ofa funeral pyre consuming all her earthly affections. The tearsburst out of her eyes."Antonia will kill herself!" she cried out.This cry fell into the silence of the room with strangely littleeffect. Only the doctor, crumbling up a piece of bread, with hishead inclined on one side, raised his face, and the few longhairs sticking out of his shaggy eyebrows stirred in a slightfrown. Dr.  Monygham thought quite sincerely that Decoud was asingularly unworthy object for any woman's affection.  Then helowered his head again, with a curl of his lip, and his heartfull of tender admiration for Mrs. Gould."She thinks of that girl," he said to himself; "she thinks of theViola children; she thinks of me; of the wounded; of the miners;she always thinks of everybody who is poor and miserable! Butwhat will she do if Charles gets the worst of it in this infernalscrimmage those confounded Avellanos have drawn him into? No oneseems to be thinking of her."Charles Gould, staring at the wall, pursued his reflectionssubtly."I shall write to Holroyd that the San Tome mine is big enough totake in hand the making of a new State.  It'll please him. It'llreconcile him to the risk."But was Barrios really available? Perhaps. But he wasinaccessible. To send off a boat to Cayta was no longer possible,since Sotillo was master of the harbour, and had a steamer at hisdisposal. And now, with all the democrats in the province up, andevery Campo township in a state of disturbance, where could hefind a man who would make his way successfully overland to Caytawith a message, a ten days' ride at least; a man of courage andresolution, who would avoid arrest or murder, and if arrestedwould faithfully eat the paper?  The Capataz de Cargadores wouldhave been just such a man. But the Capataz of the Cargadores wasno more.And Charles Gould, withdrawing his eyes from the wall, saidgently, "That Hirsch! What an extraordinary thing! Saved himselfby clinging to the anchor, did he? I had no idea that he wasstill in Sulaco.  I thought he had gone back overland toEsmeralda more than a week ago. He came here once to talk to meabout his hide business and some other things.  I made it clearto him that nothing could be done.""He was afraid to start back on account of Hernandez beingabout," remarked the doctor."And but for him we might not have known anything of what hashappened," marvelled Charles Gould.Mrs. Gould cried out--"Antonia must not know! She must not be told.  Not now.""Nobody's likely to carry the news," remarked the doctor. "It'sno one's interest. Moreover, the people here are afraid ofHernandez as if he were the devil." He turned to Charles Gould."It's even awkward, because if you wanted to communicate with therefugees you could find no messenger. When Hernandez was ranginghundreds of miles away from here the Sulaco populace used toshudder at the tales of him roasting his prisoners alive.""Yes," murmured Charles Gould; "Captain Mitchell's Capataz wasthe only man in the town who had seen Hernandez eye to eye.Father Corbelan employed him. He opened the communications first.It is a pity that--"His voice was covered by the booming of the great bell of thecathedral. Three single strokes, one after another, burst outexplosively, dying away in deep and mellow vibrations. And thenall the bells in the tower of every church, convent, or chapel intown, even those that had remained shut up for years, pealed outtogether with a crash. In this furious flood of metallic uproarthere was a power of suggesting images of strife and violencewhich blanched Mrs. Gould's cheek.  Basilio, who had been waitingat table, shrinking within himself, clung to the sideboard withchattering teeth.  It was impossible to hear yourself speak."Shut these windows!" Charles Gould yelled at him, angrily. Allthe other servants, terrified at what they took for the signal ofa general massacre, had rushed upstairs, tumbling over eachother, men and women, the obscure and generally invisiblepopulation of the ground floor on the four sides of the patio.The women, screaming "Misericordia!" ran right into the room,and, falling on their knees against the walls, began to crossthemselves convulsively. The staring heads of men blocked thedoorway in an instant--mozos from the stable, gardeners,nondescript helpers living on the crumbs of the munificenthouse--and Charles Gould beheld all the extent of his domesticestablishment, even to the gatekeeper. This was a half-paralyzedold man, whose long white locks fell down to his shoulders: anheirloom taken up by Charles Gould's familial piety. He couldremember Henry Gould, an Englishman and a Costaguanero of thesecond generation, chief of the Sulaco province; he had been hispersonal mozo years and years ago in peace and war; had beenallowed to attend his master in prison; had, on the fatalmorning, followed the firing squad; and, peeping from behind oneof the cypresses growing along the wall of the FranciscanConvent, had seen, with his eyes starting out of his head, DonEnrique throw up his hands and fall with his face in the dust.Charles Gould noted particularly the big patriarchal head of thatwitness in the rear of the other servants. But he was surprisedto see a shrivelled old hag or two, of whose existence within thewalls of his house he had not been aware. They must have been themothers, or even the grandmothers of some of his people.  Therewere a few children, too, more or less naked, crying and clingingto the legs of their elders. He had never before noticed any signof a child in his patio. Even Leonarda, the camerista, came in afright, pushing through, with her spoiled, pouting face of afavourite maid, leading the Viola girls by the hand. The crockeryrattled on table and sideboard, and the whole house seemed tosway in the deafening wave of sound.CHAPTER FIVEDURING the night the expectant populace had taken possession ofall the belfries in the town in order to welcome Pedrito Montero,who was making his entry after having slept the night in Rincon.And first came straggling in through the land gate the armed mobof all colours, complexions, types, and states of raggedness,calling themselves the Sulaco National Guard, and commanded bySenor Gamacho. Through the middle of the street streamed, like atorrent of rubbish, a mass of straw hats, ponchos, gun-barrels,with an enormous green and yellow flag flapping in their midst,in a cloud of dust, to the furious beating of drums. Thespectators recoiled against the walls of the houses shoutingtheir Vivas! Behind the rabble could be seen the lances of thecavalry, the "army" of Pedro Montero.  He advanced betweenSenores Fuentes and Gamacho at the head of his llaneros, who hadaccomplished the feat of crossing the Paramos of the Higuerota ina snow-storm. They rode four abreast, mounted on confiscatedCampo horses, clad in the heterogeneous stock of roadside storesthey had looted hurriedly in their rapid ride through thenorthern part of the province; for Pedro Montero had been in agreat hurry to occupy Sulaco. The handkerchiefs knotted looselyaround their bare throats were glaringly new, and all the rightsleeves of their cotton shirts had been cut off close to theshoulder for greater freedom in throwing the lazo. Emaciatedgreybeards rode by the side of lean dark youths, marked by allthe hardships of campaigning, with strips of raw beef twined roundthe crowns of their hats, and huge iron spurs fastened to theirnaked heels.  Those that in the passes of the mountain had losttheir lances had provided themselves with the goads used by theCampo cattlemen: slender shafts of palm fully ten feet long, witha lot of loose rings jingling under the ironshod point. They werearmed with knives and revolvers. A haggard fearlessnesscharacterized the expression of all these sun-blackedcountenances; they glared down haughtily with their scorched eyesat the crowd, or, blinking upwards insolently, pointed out toeach other some particular head amongst the women at the windows.When they had ridden into the Plaza and caught sight of theequestrian statue of the King dazzlingly white in the sunshine,towering enormous and motionless above the surges of the crowd,with its eternal gesture of saluting, a murmur of surprise ranthrough their ranks. "What is that saint in the big hat?" theyasked each other.They were a good sample of the cavalry of the plains with whichPedro Montero had helped so much the victorious career of hisbrother the general. The influence which that man, brought up incoast towns, acquired in a short time over the plainsmen of theRepublic can be ascribed only to a genius for treachery of soeffective a kind that it must have appeared to those violent menbut little removed from a state of utter savagery, as theperfection of sagacity and virtue. The popular lore of allnations testifies that duplicity and cunning, together withbodily strength, were looked upon, even more than courage, asheroic virtues by primitive mankind.  To overcome your adversarywas the great affair of life. Courage was taken for granted. Butthe use of intelligence awakened wonder and respect.  Stratagems,providing they did not fail, were honourable; the easy massacreof an unsuspecting enemy evoked no feelings but those ofgladness, pride, and admiration.  Not perhaps that primitive menwere more faithless than their descendants of to-day, but thatthey went straighter to their aim, and were more artless in theirrecognition of success as the only standard of morality.We have changed since. The use of intelligence awakens littlewonder and less respect. But the ignorant and barbarous plainsmenengaging in civil strife followed willingly a leader who oftenmanaged to deliver their enemies bound, as it were, into theirhands. Pedro Montero had a talent for lulling his adversariesinto a sense of security. And as men learn wisdom with extremeslowness, and are always ready to believe promises that flattertheir secret hopes, Pedro Montero was successful time after time.Whether only a servant or some inferior official in theCostaguana Legation in Paris, he had rushed back to his countrydirectly he heard that his brother had emerged from the obscurityof his frontier commandancia. He had managed to deceive by hisgift of plausibility the chiefs of the Ribierist movement in thecapital, and even the acute agent of the San Tome mine had failedto understand him thoroughly.  At once he had obtained anenormous influence over his brother. They were very much alike inappearance, both bald, with bunches of crisp hair above theirears, arguing the presence of some negro blood. Only Pedro wassmaller than the general, more delicate altogether, with anape-like faculty for imitating all the outward signs ofrefinement and distinction, and with a parrot-like talent forlanguages. Both brothers had received some elementary instructionby the munificence of a great European traveller, to whom theirfather had been a body-servant during his journeys in theinterior of the country. In General Montero's case it enabled himto rise from the ranks. Pedrito, the younger, incorrigibly lazyand slovenly, had drifted aimlessly from one coast town toanother, hanging about counting-houses, attaching himself tostrangers as a sort of valet-de-place, picking up an easy anddisreputable living.  His ability to read did nothing for him butfill his head with absurd visions. His actions were usuallydetermined by motives so improbable in themselves as to escapethe penetration of a rational person.Thus at first sight the agent of the Gould Concession in Sta.Marta had credited him with the possession of sane views, andeven with a restraining power over the general's everlastinglydiscontented vanity. It could never have entered his head thatPedrito Montero, lackey or inferior scribe, lodged in the garretsof the various Parisian hotels where the Costaguana Legation usedto shelter its diplomatic dignity, had been devouring the lightersort of historical works in the French language, such, forinstance as the books of Imbert de Saint Amand upon the SecondEmpire. But Pedrito had been struck by the splendour of abrilliant court, and had conceived the idea of an existence forhimself where, like the Duc de Morny, he would associate thecommand of every pleasure with the conduct of political affairsand enjoy power supremely in every way. Nobody could have guessedthat. And yet this was one of the immediate causes of theMonterist Revolution.  This will appear less incredible by thereflection that the fundamental causes were the same as ever,rooted in the political immaturity of the people, in theindolence of the upper classes and the mental darkness of thelower.Pedrito Montero saw in the elevation of his brother the road wideopen to his wildest imaginings. This was what made the Monteristpronunciamiento so unpreventable.  The general himself probablycould have been bought off, pacified with flatteries, despatchedon a diplomatic mission to Europe. It was his brother who hadegged him on from first to last. He wanted to become the mostbrilliant statesman of South America.  He did not desire supremepower. He would have been afraid of its labour and risk, in fact.Before all, Pedrito Montero, taught by his European experience,meant to acquire a serious fortune for himself. With this objectin view he obtained from his brother, on the very morrow of thesuccessful battle, the permission to push on over the mountainsand take possession of Sulaco. Sulaco was the land of futureprosperity, the chosen land of material progress, the onlyprovince in the Republic of interest to European capitalists.Pedrito Montero, following the example of the Duc de Morny, meantto have his share of this prosperity.  This is what he meantliterally. Now his brother was master of the country, whether asPresident, Dictator, or even as Emperor--why not as anEmperor?--he meant to demand a share in every enterprise--inrailways, in mines, in sugar estates, in cotton mills, in landcompanies, in each and every undertaking--as the price of hisprotection. The desire to be on the spot early was the real causeof the celebrated ride over the mountains with some two hundredllaneros, an enterprise of which the dangers had not appeared atfirst clearly to his impatience. Coming from a series ofvictories, it seemed to him that a Montero had only to appear tobe master of the situation. This illusion had betrayed him into arashness of which he was becoming aware. As he rode at the headof his llaneros he regretted that there were so few of them. Theenthusiasm of the populace reassured him. They yelled "VivaMontero! Viva Pedrito!" In order to make them still moreenthusiastic, and from the natural pleasure he had indissembling, he dropped the reins on his horse's neck, and with atremendous effect of familiarity and confidence slipped his handsunder the arms of Senores Fuentes and Gamacho. In that posture,with a ragged town mozo holding his horse by the bridle, he rodetriumphantly across the Plaza to the door of the Intendencia. Itsold gloomy walls seemed to shake in the acclamations that rentthe air and covered the crashing peals of the cathedral bells.Pedro Montero, the brother of the general, dismounted into ashouting and perspiring throng of enthusiasts whom the raggedNationals were pushing back fiercely. Ascending a few steps hesurveyed the large crowd gaping at him. and the bullet-speckledwalls of the houses opposite lightly veiled by a sunny haze ofdust. The word "PORVENIR" in immense black capitals, alternatingwith broken windows, stared at him across the vast space; and hethought with delight of the hour of vengeance, because he wasvery sure of laying his hands upon Decoud. On his left hand,Gamacho, big and hot, wiping his hairy wet face, uncovered a setof yellow fangs in a grin of stupid hilarity.  On his right,Senor Fuentes, small and lean, looked on with compressed lips.The crowd stared literally open-mouthed, lost in eager stillness,as though they had expected the great guerrillero, the famousPedrito, to begin scattering at once some sort of visiblelargesse. What he began was a speech. He began it with theshouted word "Citizens!" which reached even those in the middleof the Plaza. Afterwards the greater part of the citizensremained fascinated by the orator's action alone, his tip-toeing,the arms flung above his head with the fists clenched, a handlaid flat upon the heart, the silver gleam of rolling eyes, thesweeping, pointing, embracing gestures, a hand laid familiarly onGamacho's shoulder; a hand waved formally towards the littleblack-coated person of Senor Fuentes, advocate and politician anda true friend of the people. The vivas of those nearest to theorator bursting out suddenly propagated themselves irregularly tothe confines of the crowd, like flames running over dry grass,and expired in the opening of the streets. In the intervals, overthe swarming Plaza brooded a heavy silence, in which the mouth ofthe orator went on opening and shutting, and detachedphrases--"The happiness of the people," "Sons of the country,""The entire world, el mundo entiero"--reached even the packedsteps of the cathedral with a feeble clear ring, thin as thebuzzing of a mosquito.  But the orator struck his breast; heseemed to prance between his two supporters. It was the supremeeffort of his peroration. Then the two smaller figuresdisappeared from the public gaze and the enormous Gamacho, leftalone, advanced, raising his hat high above his head. Then hecovered himself proudly and yelled out, "Ciudadanos!" A dull roargreeted Senor Gamacho, ex-pedlar of the Campo, Commandante of theNational Guards.Upstairs Pedrito Montero walked about rapidly from one wreckedroom of the Intendencia to another, snarling incessantly--"What stupidity! What destruction!"Senor Fuentes, following, would relax his taciturn disposition tomurmur--"It is all the work of Gamacho and his Nationals;" and then,inclining his head on his left shoulder, would press together hislips so firmly that a little hollow would appear at each corner.He had his nomination for Political Chief of the town in hispocket, and was all impatience to enter upon his functions.In the long audience room, with its tall mirrors all starred bystones, the hangings torn down and the canopy over the platformat the upper end pulled to pieces, the vast, deep muttering ofthe crowd and the howling voice of Gamacho speaking just belowreached them through the shutters as they stood idly in dimnessand desolation."The brute!" observed his Excellency Don Pedro Montero throughclenched teeth. "We must contrive as quickly as possible to sendhim and his Nationals out there to fight Hernandez."The new Gefe Politico only jerked his head sideways, and took apuff at his cigarette in sign of his agreement with this methodfor ridding the town of Gamacho and his inconvenient rabble.Pedrito Montero looked with disgust at the absolutely bare floor,and at the belt of heavy gilt picture-frames running round theroom, out of which the remnants of torn and slashed canvasesfluttered like dingy rags."We are not barbarians," he said.This was what said his Excellency, the popular Pedrito, theguerrillero skilled in the art of laying ambushes, charged by hisbrother at his own demand with the organization of Sulaco ondemocratic principles. The night before, during the consultationwith his partisans, who had come out to meet him in Rincon, hehad opened his intentions to Senor Fuentes--"We shall organize a popular vote, by yes or no, confiding thedestinies of our beloved country to the wisdom and valiance of myheroic brother, the invincible general.  A plebiscite. Do youunderstand?"And Senor Fuentes, puffing out his leathery cheeks, had inclinedhis head slightly to the left, letting a thin, bluish jet ofsmoke escape through his pursed lips. He had understood.His Excellency was exasperated at the devastation.  Not a singlechair, table, sofa, etagere or console had been left in the staterooms of the Intendencia. His Excellency, though twitching allover with rage, was restrained from bursting into violence by asense of his remoteness and isolation. His heroic brother wasvery far away. Meantime, how was he going to take his siesta? Hehad expected to find comfort and luxury in the Intendencia aftera year of hard camp life, ending with the hardships andprivations of the daring dash upon Sulaco--upon the provincewhich was worth more in wealth and influence than all the rest ofthe Republic's territory.  He would get even with Gamachoby-and-by. And Senor Gamacho's oration, delectable to popularears, went on in the heat and glare of the Plaza like the uncouthhowlings of an inferior sort of devil cast into a white-hotfurnace. Every moment he had to wipe his streaming face with hisbare fore-arm; he had flung off his coat, and had turned up thesleeves of his shirt high above the elbows; but he kept on hishead the large cocked hat with white plumes.  His ingenuousnesscherished this sign of his rank as Commandante of the NationalGuards. Approving and grave murmurs greeted his periods. Hisopinion was that war should be declared at once against France,England, Germany, and the United States, who, by introducingrailways, mining enterprises, colonization, and under such othershallow pretences, aimed at robbing poor people of their lands,and with the help of these Goths and paralytics, the aristocratswould convert them into toiling and miserable slaves.  And theleperos, flinging about the corners of their dirty white mantas,yelled their approbation. General Montero, Gamacho howled withconviction, was the only man equal to the patriotic task. Theyassented to that, too.The morning was wearing on; there were already signs ofdisruption, currents and eddies in the crowd. Some were seekingthe shade of the walls and under the trees of the Alameda.Horsemen spurred through, shouting; groups of sombreros set levelon heads against the vertical sun were drifting away into thestreets, where the open doors of pulperias revealed an enticinggloom resounding with the gentle tinkling of guitars. TheNational Guards were thinking of siesta, and the eloquence ofGamacho, their chief, was exhausted. Later on, when, in thecooler hours of the afternoon, they tried to assemble again forfurther consideration of public affairs, detachments of Montero'scavalry camped on the Alameda charged them without parley, atspeed, with long lances levelled at their flying backs as far asthe ends of the streets. The National Guards of Sulaco weresurprised by this proceeding. But they were not indignant. NoCostaguanero had ever learned to question the eccentricities of amilitary force.  They were part of the natural order of things.This must be, they concluded, some kind of administrativemeasure, no doubt. But the motive of it escaped their unaidedintelligence, and their chief and orator, Gamacho, Commandante ofthe National Guard, was lying drunk and asleep in the bosom ofhis family. His bare feet were upturned in the shadowsrepulsively, in the manner of a corpse. His eloquent mouth haddropped open. His youngest daughter, scratching her head with onehand, with the other waved a green bough over his scorched andpeeling face.CHAPTER SIXTHE declining sun had shifted the shadows from west to eastamongst the houses of the town. It had shifted them upon thewhole extent of the immense Campo, with the white walls of itshaciendas on the knolls dominating the green distances; with itsgrass-thatched ranches crouching in the folds of ground by thebanks of streams; with the dark islands of clustered trees on aclear sea of grass, and the precipitous range of the Cordillera,immense and motionless, emerging from the billows of the lowerforests like the barren coast of a land of giants. The sunsetrays striking the snow-slope of Higuerota from afar gave it anair of rosy youth, while the serrated mass of distant peaksremained black, as if calcined in the fiery radiance. Theundulating surface of the forests seemed powdered with pale golddust; and away there, beyond Rincon, hidden from the town by twowooded spurs, the rocks of the San Tome gorge, with the flat wallof the mountain itself crowned by gigantic ferns, took on warmtones of brown and yellow, with red rusty streaks, and the darkgreen clumps of bushes rooted in crevices. From the plain thestamp sheds and the houses of the mine appeared dark and small,high up, like the nests of birds clustered on the ledges of acliff. The zigzag paths resembled faint tracings scratched on thewall of a cyclopean blockhouse.  To the two serenos of the mineon patrol duty, strolling, carbine in hand, and watchful eyes, inthe shade of the trees lining the stream near the bridge, DonPepe, descending the path from the upper plateau, appeared nobigger than a large beetle.With his air of aimless, insect-like going to and fro upon theface of the rock, Don Pepe's figure kept on descending steadily,and, when near the bottom, sank at last behind the roofs ofstore-houses, forges, and workshops. For a time the pair ofserenos strolled back and forth before the bridge, on which theyhad stopped a horseman holding a large white envelope in hishand. Then Don Pepe, emerging in the village street from amongstthe houses, not a stone's throw from the frontier bridge,approached, striding in wide dark trousers tucked into boots, awhite linen jacket, sabre at his side, and revolver at his belt.In this disturbed time nothing could find the Senor Gobernadorwith his boots off, as the saying is.At a slight nod from one of the serenos, the man, a messengerfrom the town, dismounted, and crossed the bridge, leading hishorse by the bridle.Don Pepe received the letter from his other hand, slapped hisleft side and his hips in succession, feeling for his spectaclecase. After settling the heavy silvermounted affair astride hisnose, and adjusting it carefully behind his ears, he opened theenvelope, holding it up at about a foot in front of his eyes. Thepaper he pulled out contained some three lines of writing. Helooked at them for a long time. His grey moustache moved slightlyup and down, and the wrinkles, radiating at the corners of hiseyes, ran together. He nodded serenely. "Bueno," he said. "Thereis no answer."Then, in his quiet, kindly way, he engaged in a cautiousconversation with the man, who was willing to talk cheerily, asif something lucky had happened to him recently. He had seen froma distance Sotillo's infantry camped along the shore of theharbour on each side of the Custom House. They had done no damageto the buildings. The foreigners of the railway remained shut upwithin the yards. They were no longer anxious to shoot poorpeople. He cursed the foreigners; then he reported Montero'sentry and the rumours of the town. The poor were going to be maderich now.  That was very good. More he did not know, and,breaking into propitiatory smiles, he intimated that he washungry and thirsty. The old major directed him to go to thealcalde of the first village. The man rode off, and Don Pepe,striding slowly in the direction of a little wooden belfry,looked over a hedge into a little garden, and saw Father Romansitting in a white hammock slung between two orange trees infront of the presbytery.An enormous tamarind shaded with its dark foliage the whole whiteframehouse. A young Indian girl with long hair, big eyes, andsmall hands and feet, carried out a wooden chair, while a thinold woman, crabbed and vigilant, watched her all the time fromthe verandah.Don Pepe sat down in the chair and lighted a cigar; the priestdrew in an immense quantity of snuff out of the hollow of hispalm. On his reddish-brown face, worn, hollowed as if crumbled,the eyes, fresh and candid, sparkled like two black diamonds.Don Pepe, in a mild and humorous voice, informed Father Romanthat Pedrito Montero, by the hand of Senor Fuentes, had asked himon what terms he would surrender the mine in proper working orderto a legally constituted commission of patriotic citizens,escorted by a small military force. The priest cast his eyes upto heaven. However, Don Pepe continued, the mozo who brought theletter said that Don Carlos Gould was alive, and so farunmolested.Father Roman expressed in a few words his thankfulness at hearingof the Senor Administrador's safety.The hour of oration had gone by in the silvery ringing of a bellin the little belfry. The belt of forest closing the entrance ofthe valley stood like a screen between the low sun and the streetof the village. At the other end of the rocky gorge, between thewalls of basalt and granite, a forest-clad mountain, hiding allthe range from the San Tome dwellers, rose steeply, lighted upand leafy to the very top. Three small rosy clouds hungmotionless overhead in the great depth of blue. Knots of peoplesat in the street between the wattled huts. Before the casa ofthe alcalde, the foremen of the night-shift, already assembled tolead their men, squatted on the ground in a circle of leatherskull-caps, and, bowing their bronze backs, were passing roundthe gourd of mate. The mozo from the town, having fastened hishorse to a wooden post before the door, was telling them the newsof Sulaco as the blackened gourd of the decoction passed fromhand to hand. The grave alcalde himself, in a white waistclothand a flowered chintz gown with sleeves, open wide upon his nakedstout person with an effect of a gaudy bathing robe, stood by,wearing a rough beaver hat at the back of his head, and graspinga tall staff with a silver knob in his hand. These insignia ofhis dignity had been conferred upon him by the Administration ofthe mine, the fountain of honour, of prosperity, and peace. Hehad been one of the first immigrants into this valley; his sonsand sons-in-law worked within the mountain which seemed with itstreasures to pour down the thundering ore shoots of the uppermesa, the gifts of well-being, security, and justice upon thetoilers. He listened to the news from the town with curiosity andindifference, as if concerning another world than his own. And itwas true that they appeared to him so. In a very few years thesense of belonging to a powerful organization had been developedin these harassed, half-wild Indians. They were proud of, andattached to, the mine. It had secured their confidence andbelief. They invested it with a protecting and invincible virtueas though it were a fetish made by their own hands, for they wereignorant, and in other respects did not differ appreciably fromthe rest of mankind which puts infinite trust in its owncreations. It never entered the alcalde's head that the minecould fail in its protection and force. Politics were good enoughfor the people of the town and the Campo. His yellow, round face,with wide nostrils, and motionless in expression, resembled afierce full moon. He listened to the excited vapourings of themozo without misgivings, without surprise, without any activesentiment whatever.Padre Roman sat dejectedly balancing himself, his feet justtouching the ground, his hands gripping the edge of the hammock.With less confidence, but as ignorant as his flock, he asked themajor what did he think was going to happen now.Don Pepe, bolt upright in the chair, folded his hands peacefullyon the hilt of his sword, standing perpendicular between histhighs, and answered that he did not know. The mine could bedefended against any force likely to be sent to take possession.On the other hand, from the arid character of the valley, whenthe regular supplies from the Campo had been cut off, thepopulation of the three villages could be starved intosubmission.  Don Pepe exposed these contingencies with serenityto Father Roman, who, as an old campaigner, was able tounderstand the reasoning of a military man.  They talked withsimplicity and directness. Father Roman was saddened at the ideaof his flock being scattered or else enslaved. He had noillusions as to their fate, not from penetration, but from longexperience of political atrocities, which seemed to him fatal andunavoidable in the life of a State. The working of the usualpublic institutions presented itself to him most distinctly as aseries of calamities overtaking private individuals and flowinglogically from each other through hate, revenge, folly, andrapacity, as though they had been part of a divine dispensation.Father Roman's clear-sightedness was served by an uninformedintelligence; but his heart, preserving its tenderness amongstscenes of carnage, spoliation, and violence, abhorred thesecalamities the more as his association with the victims wascloser. He entertained towards the Indians of the valley feelingsof paternal scorn.  He had been marrying, baptizing, confessing,absolving, and burying the workers of the San Tome mine withdignity and unction for five years or more; and he believed inthe sacredness of these ministrations, which made them his own ina spiritual sense. They were dear to his sacerdotal supremacy.Mrs. Gould's earnest interest in the concerns of these peopleenhanced their importance in the priest's eyes, because it reallyaugmented his own. When talking over with her the innumerableMarias and Brigidas of the villages, he felt his own humanityexpand. Padre Roman was incapable of fanaticism to an almostreprehensible degree.  The English senora was evidently aheretic; but at the same time she seemed to him wonderful andangelic.  Whenever that confused state of his feelings occurredto him, while strolling, for instance, his breviary under hisarm, in the wide shade of the tamarind, he would stop short toinhale with a strong snuffling noise a large quantity of snuff,and shake his head profoundly. At the thought of what mightbefall the illustrious senora presently, he became graduallyovercome with dismay.  He voiced it in an agitated murmur. EvenDon Pepe lost his serenity for a moment. He leaned forwardstiffly."Listen, Padre. The very fact that those thieving macaques inSulaco are trying to find out the price of my honour proves thatSenor Don Carlos and all in the Casa Gould are safe. As to myhonour, that also is safe, as every man, woman, and child knows.But the negro Liberals who have snatched the town by surprise donot know that. Bueno. Let them sit and wait. While they wait theycan do no harm."And he regained his composure. He regained it easily, becausewhatever happened his honour of an old officer of Paez was safe.He had promised Charles Gould that at the approach of an armedforce he would defend the gorge just long enough to give himselftime to destroy scientifically the whole plant, buildings, andworkshops of the mine with heavy charges of dynamite; block withruins the main tunnel, break down the pathways, blow up the damof the water-power, shatter the famous Gould Concession intofragments, flying sky high out of a horrified world. The mine hadgot hold of Charles Gould with a grip as deadly as ever it hadlaid upon his father. But this extreme resolution had seemed toDon Pepe the most natural thing in the world. His measures hadbeen taken with judgment.  Everything was prepared with a carefulcompleteness.  And Don Pepe folded his hands pacifically on hissword hilt, and nodded at the priest. In his excitement, FatherRoman had flung snuff in handfuls at his face, and, all besmearedwith tobacco, round-eyed, and beside himself, had got out of thehammock to walk about, uttering exclamations.Don Pepe stroked his grey and pendant moustache, whose fine endshung far below the clean-cut line of his jaw, and spoke with aconscious pride in his reputation."So, Padre, I don't know what will happen. But I know that aslong as I am here Don Carlos can speak to that macaque, PedritoMontero, and threaten the destruction of the mine with perfectassurance that he will be taken seriously. For people know me."He began to turn the cigar in his lips a little nervously, andwent on--"But that is talk--good for the politicos. I am a military man. Ido not know what may happen. But I know what ought to bedone--the mine should march upon the town with guns, axes, knivestied up to sticks--por Dios. That is what should be done.Only--"His folded hands twitched on the hilt. The cigar turned faster inthe corner of his lips."And who should lead but I? Unfortunately--observe--I have givenmy word of honour to Don Carlos not to let the mine fall into thehands of these thieves.  In war--you know this, Padre--the fateof battles is uncertain, and whom could I leave here to act forme in case of defeat? The explosives are ready. But it wouldrequire a man of high honour, of intelligence, of judgment, ofcourage, to carry out the prepared destruction.  Somebody I cantrust with my honour as I can trust myself. Another old officerof Paez, for instance.  Or--or--perhaps one of Paez's oldchaplains would do."He got up, long, lank, upright, hard, with his martial moustacheand the bony structure of his face, from which the glance of thesunken eyes seemed to transfix the priest, who stood still, anempty wooden snuff-box held upside down in his hand, and glaredback, speechless, at the governor of the mine.CHAPTER SEVENAT ABOUT that time, in the Intendencia of Sulaco, Charles Gouldwas assuring Pedrito Montero, who had sent a request for hispresence there, that he would never let the mine pass out of hishands for the profit of a Government who had robbed him of it.The Gould Concession could not be resumed. His father had notdesired it. The son would never surrender it. He would neversurrender it alive. And once dead, where was the power capable ofresuscitating such an enterprise in all its vigour and wealth outof the ashes and ruin of destruction? There was no such power inthe country. And where was the skill and capital abroad thatwould condescend to touch such an ill-omened corpse? CharlesGould talked in the impassive tone which had for many yearsserved to conceal his anger and contempt. He suffered. He wasdisgusted with what he had to say. It was too much like heroics.In him the strictly practical instinct was in profound discordwith the almost mystic view he took of his right.  The GouldConcession was symbolic of abstract justice.  Let the heavensfall. But since the San Tome mine had developed into world-widefame his threat had enough force and effectiveness to reach therudimentary intelligence of Pedro Montero, wrapped up as it wasin the futilities of historical anecdotes.  The Gould Concessionwas a serious asset in the country's finance, and, what was more,in the private budgets of many officials as well. It wastraditional. It was known.  It was said. It was credible. EveryMinister of Interior drew a salary from the San Tome mine. It wasnatural. And Pedrito intended to be Minister of the Interior andPresident of the Council in his brother's Government. The Duc deMorny had occupied those high posts during the Second FrenchEmpire with conspicuous advantage to himself.A table, a chair, a wooden bedstead had been procured for HisExcellency, who, after a short siesta, rendered absolutelynecessary by the labours and the pomps of his entry into Sulaco,had been getting hold of the administrative machine by makingappointments, giving orders, and signing proclamations. Alonewith Charles Gould in the audience room, His Excellency managedwith his well-known skill to conceal his annoyance andconsternation.  He had begun at first to talk loftily ofconfiscation, but the want of all proper feeling and mobility inthe Senor Administrador's features ended by affecting adverselyhis power of masterful expression. Charles Gould had repeated:"The Government can certainly bring about the destruction of theSan Tome mine if it likes; but without me it can do nothingelse." It was an alarming pronouncement, and well calculated tohurt the sensibilities of a politician whose mind is bent uponthe spoils of victory. And Charles Gould said also that thedestruction of the San Tome mine would cause the ruin of otherundertakings, the withdrawal of European capital, thewithholding, most probably, of the last instalment of the foreignloan. That stony fiend of a man said all these things (which wereaccessible to His Excellency's intelligence) in a coldbloodedmanner which made one shudder.A long course of reading historical works, light and gossipy intone, carried out in garrets of Parisian hotels, sprawling on anuntidy bed, to the neglect of his duties, menial or otherwise,had affected the manners of Pedro Montero. Had he seen around himthe splendour of the old Intendencia, the magnificent hangings,the gilt furniture ranged along the walls; had he stood upon adais on a noble square of red carpet, he would have probably beenvery dangerous from a sense of success and elevation. But in thissacked and devastated residence, with the three pieces of commonfurniture huddled up in the middle of the vast apartment,Pedrito's imagination was subdued by a feeling of insecurity andimpermanence.   That feeling and the firm attitude of CharlesGould who had not once, so far, pronounced the word "Excellency,"diminished him in his own eyes.  He assumed the tone of anenlightened man of the world, and begged Charles Gould to dismissfrom his mind every cause for alarm. He was now conversing, hereminded him, with the brother of the master of the country,charged with a reorganizing mission. The trusted brother of themaster of the country, he repeated.  Nothing was further from thethoughts of that wise and patriotic hero than ideas ofdestruction.  "I entreat you, Don Carlos, not to give way to youranti-democratic prejudices," he cried, in a burst ofcondescending effusion.Pedrito Montero surprised one at first sight by the vastdevelopment of his bald forehead, a shiny yellow expanse betweenthe crinkly coal-black tufts of hair without any lustre, theengaging form of his mouth, and an unexpectedly cultivated voice.But his eyes, very glistening as if freshly painted on each sideof his hooked nose, had a round, hopeless, birdlike stare whenopened fully. Now, however, he narrowed them agreeably, throwinghis square chin up and speaking with closed teeth slightlythrough the nose, with what he imagined to be the manner of agrand seigneur.In that attitude, he declared suddenly that the highestexpression of democracy was Caesarism: the imperial rule basedupon the direct popular vote. Caesarism was conservative. It wasstrong. It recognized the legitimate needs of democracy whichrequires orders, titles, and distinctions. They would be showeredupon deserving men. Caesarism was peace. It was progressive. Itsecured the prosperity of a country.  Pedrito Montero was carriedaway. Look at what the Second Empire had done for France. It wasa regime which delighted to honour men of Don Carlos's stamp.The Second Empire fell, but that was because its chief was devoidof that military genius which had raised General Montero to thepinnacle of fame and glory.  Pedrito elevated his hand jerkily tohelp the idea of pinnacle, of fame. "We shall have many talksyet.  We shall understand each other thoroughly, Don Carlos!" hecried in a tone of fellowship. Republicanism had done its work.Imperial democracy was the power of the future. Pedrito, theguerrillero, showing his hand, lowered his voice forcibly. A mansingled out by his fellow-citizens for the honourable nickname ofEl Rey de Sulaco could not but receive a full recognition from animperial democracy as a great captain of industry and a person ofweighty counsel, whose popular designation would be soon replacedby a more solid title. "Eh, Don Carlos? No! What do you say?Conde de Sulaco--Eh?--or marquis . . ."He ceased. The air was cool on the Plaza, where a patrol ofcavalry rode round and round without penetrating into thestreets, which resounded with shouts and the strumming of guitarsissuing from the open doors of pulperias. The orders were not tointerfere with the enjoyments of the people. And above the roofs,next to the perpendicular lines of the cathedral towers the snowycurve of Higuerota blocked a large space of darkening blue skybefore the windows of the Intendencia.  After a time PedritoMontero, thrusting his hand in the bosom of his coat, bowed hishead with slow dignity. The audience was over.Charles Gould on going out passed his hand over his forehead asif to disperse the mists of an oppressive dream, whose grotesqueextravagance leaves behind a subtle sense of bodily danger andintellectual decay.  In the passages and on the staircases of theold palace Montero's troopers lounged about insolently, smokingand making way for no one; the clanking of sabres and spursresounded all over the building. Three silent groups of civiliansin severe black waited in the main gallery, formal and helpless,a little huddled up, each keeping apart from the others, as if inthe exercise of a public duty they had been overcome by a desireto shun the notice of every eye. These were the deputationswaiting for their audience. The one from the Provincial Assembly,more restless and uneasy in its corporate expression, wasovertopped by the big face of Don Juste Lopez, soft and white,with prominent eyelids and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity asif in a dense cloud. The President of the Provincial Assembly,coming bravely to save the last shred of parliamentaryinstitutions (on the English model), averted his eyes from theAdministrador of the San Tome mine as a dignified rebuke of hislittle faith in that only saving principle.The mournful severity of that reproof did not affect CharlesGould, but he was sensible to the glances of the others directedupon him without reproach, as if only to read their own fate uponhis face. All of them had talked, shouted, and declaimed in thegreat sala of the Casa Gould. The feeling of compassion for thosemen, struck with a strange impotence in the toils of moraldegradation, did not induce him to make a sign. He suffered fromhis fellowship in evil with them too much.  He crossed the Plazaunmolested. The Amarilla Club was full of festive ragamuffins.Their frowsy heads protruded from every window, and from withincame drunken shouts, the thumping of feet, and the twanging ofharps. Broken bottles strewed the pavement below.  Charles Gouldfound the doctor still in his house.Dr. Monygham came away from the crack in the shutter throughwhich he had been watching the street."Ah! You are back at last!" he said in a tone of relief. "I havebeen telling Mrs. Gould that you were perfectly safe, but I wasnot by any means certain that the fellow would have let you go.""Neither was I," confessed Charles Gould, laying his hat on thetable."You will have to take action."The silence of Charles Gould seemed to admit that this was theonly course. This was as far as Charles Gould was accustomed togo towards expressing his intentions."I hope you did not warn Montero of what you mean to do," thedoctor said, anxiously."I tried to make him see that the existence of the mine was boundup with my personal safety," continued Charles Gould, lookingaway from the doctor, and fixing his eyes upon the water-coloursketch upon the wall."He believed you?" the doctor asked, eagerly."God knows!" said Charles Gould. "I owed it to my wife to saythat much. He is well enough informed.  He knows that I have DonPepe there. Fuentes must have told him. They know that the oldmajor is perfectly capable of blowing up the San Tome minewithout hesitation or compunction. Had it not been for that Idon't think I'd have left the Intendencia a free man. He wouldblow everything up from loyalty and from hate--from hate of theseLiberals, as they call themselves. Liberals! The words one knowsso well have a nightmarish meaning in this country.  Liberty,democracy, patriotism, government--all of them have a flavour offolly and murder. Haven't they, doctor? . . . I alone canrestrain Don Pepe.  If they were to--to do away with me, nothingcould prevent him.""They will try to tamper with him," the doctor suggested,thoughtfully."It is very possible," Charles Gould said very low, as ifspeaking to himself, and still gazing at the sketch of the SanTome gorge upon the wall. "Yes, I expect they will try that."Charles Gould looked for the first time at the doctor. "It wouldgive me time," he added."Exactly," said Dr. Monygham, suppressing his excitement."Especially if Don Pepe behaves diplomatically.  Why shouldn't hegive them some hope of success?  Eh? Otherwise you wouldn't gainso much time.  Couldn't he be instructed to--"Charles Gould, looking at the doctor steadily, shook his head,but the doctor continued with a certain amount of fire--"Yes, to enter into negotiations for the surrender of the mine.It is a good notion. You would mature your plan. Of course, Idon't ask what it is. I don't want to know. I would refuse tolisten to you if you tried to tell me. I am not fit forconfidences.""What nonsense!" muttered Charles Gould, with displeasure.He disapproved of the doctor's sensitiveness about that far-offepisode of his life. So much memory shocked Charles Gould. It waslike morbidness. And again he shook his head. He refused totamper with the open rectitude of Don Pepe's conduct, both fromtaste and from policy. Instructions would have to be eitherverbal or in writing. In either case they ran the risk of beingintercepted. It was by no means certain that a messenger couldreach the mine; and, besides, there was no one to send. It was onthe tip of Charles's tongue to say that only the late Capataz deCargadores could have been employed with some chance of successand the certitude of discretion. But he did not say that. Hepointed out to the doctor that it would have been bad policy.Directly Don Pepe let it be supposed that he could be boughtover, the Administrador's personal safety and the safety of hisfriends would become endangered. For there would be then noreason for moderation. The incorruptibility of Don Pepe was theessential and restraining fact. The doctor hung his head andadmitted that in a way it was so.He couldn't deny to himself that the reasoning was sound enough.Don Pepe's usefulness consisted in his unstained character. As tohis own usefulness, he reflected bitterly it was also his owncharacter. He declared to Charles Gould that he had the means ofkeeping Sotillo from joining his forces with Montero, at leastfor the present."If you had had all this silver here," the doctor said, "or evenif it had been known to be at the mine, you could have bribedSotillo to throw off his recent Monterism.  You could haveinduced him either to go away in his steamer or even to joinyou.""Certainly not that last," Charles Gould declared, firmly. "Whatcould one do with a man like that, afterwards--tell me, doctor?The silver is gone, and I am glad of it. It would have been animmediate and strong temptation. The scramble for that visibleplunder would have precipitated a disastrous ending.  I wouldhave had to defend it, too. I am glad we've removed it--even ifit is lost. It would have been a danger and a curse.""Perhaps he is right," the doctor, an hour later, said hurriedlyto Mrs. Gould, whom he met in the corridor.  "The thing is done,and the shadow of the treasure may do just as well as thesubstance. Let me try to serve you to the whole extent of my evilreputation. I am off now to play my game of betrayal withSotillo, and keep him off the town."She put out both her hands impulsively. "Dr. Monygham, you arerunning a terrible risk," she whispered, averting from his faceher eyes, full of tears, for a short glance at the door of herhusband's room. She pressed both his hands, and the doctor stoodas if rooted to the spot, looking down at her, and trying totwist his lips into a smile."Oh, I know you will defend my memory," he uttered at last, andran tottering down the stairs across the patio, and out of thehouse. In the street he kept up.  a great pace with his smarthobbling walk, a case of instruments under his arm. He was knownfor being loco.  Nobody interfered with him. From under theseaward gate, across the dusty, arid plain, interspersed with lowbushes, he saw, more than a mile away, the ugly enormity of theCustom House, and the two or three other buildings which at thattime constituted the seaport of Sulaco. Far away to the southgroves of palm trees edged the curve of the harbour shore. Thedistant peaks of the Cordillera had lost their identity ofclearcut shapes in the steadily deepening blue of the easternsky. The doctor walked briskly. A darkling shadow seemed to fallupon him from the zenith. The sun had set. For a time the snowsof Higuerota continued to glow with the reflected glory of thewest. The doctor, holding a straight course for the Custom House,appeared lonely, hopping amongst the dark bushes like a tall birdwith a broken wing.Tints of purple, gold, and crimson were mirrored in the clearwater of the harbour. A long tongue of land, straight as a wall,with the grass-grown ruins of the fort making a sort of roundedgreen mound, plainly visible from the inner shore, closed itscircuit; while beyond the Placid Gulf repeated those splendoursof colouring on a greater scale and with a more sombremagnificence. The great mass of cloud filling the head of thegulf had long red smears amongst its convoluted folds of grey andblack, as of a floating mantle stained with blood. The threeIsabels, overshadowed and clear cut in a great smoothnessconfounding the sea and sky, appeared suspended, purple-black, inthe air.  The little wavelets seemed to be tossing tiny redsparks upon the sandy beaches. The glassy bands of water alongthe horizon gave out a fiery red glow, as if fire and water hadbeen mingled together in the vast bed of the ocean.At last the conflagration of sea and sky, lying embraced andstill in a flaming contact upon the edge of the world, went out.The red sparks in the water vanished together with the stains ofblood in the black mantle draping the sombre head of the PlacidGulf; a sudden breeze sprang up and died out after rustlingheavily the growth of bushes on the ruined earthwork of the fort.Nostromo woke up from a fourteen hours' sleep, and arose fulllength from his lair in the long grass.  He stood knee deepamongst the whispering undulations of the green blades with thelost air of a man just born into the world. Handsome, robust, andsupple, he threw back his head, flung his arms open, andstretched himself with a slow twist of the waist and a leisurelygrowling yawn of white teeth, as natural and free from evil inthe moment of waking as a magnificent and unconscious wild beast.Then, in the suddenly steadied glance fixed upon nothing fromunder a thoughtful frown, appeared the man.CHAPTER EIGHTAFTER landing from his swim Nostromo had scrambled up, alldripping, into the main quadrangle of the old fort; and there,amongst ruined bits of walls and rotting remnants of roofs andsheds, he had slept the day through. He had slept in the shadowof the mountains, in the white blaze of noon, in the stillnessand solitude of that overgrown piece of land between the oval ofthe harbour and the spacious semi-circle of the gulf. He lay asif dead. A rey-zamuro, appearing like a tiny black speck in theblue, stooped, circling prudently with a stealthiness of flightstartling in a bird of that great size. The shadow of hispearly-white body, of his black-tipped wings, fell on the grassno more silently than he alighted himself on a hillock of rubbishwithin three yards of that man, lying as still as a corpse. Thebird stretched his bare neck, craned his bald head, loathsome inthe brilliance of varied colouring, with an air of voraciousanxiety towards the promising stillness of that prostrate body.Then, sinking his head deeply into his soft plumage, he settledhimself to wait. The first thing upon which Nostromo's eyes fellon waking was this patient watcher for the signs of death andcorruption. When the man got up the vulture hopped away in great,side-long, fluttering jumps. He lingered for a while, morose andreluctant, before he rose, circling noiselessly with a sinisterdroop of beak and claws.Long after he had vanished, Nostromo, lifting his eyes up to thesky, muttered, "I am not dead yet."The Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores had lived in splendour andpublicity up to the very moment, as it were, when he took chargeof the lighter containing the treasure of silver ingots.The last act he had performed in Sulaco was in complete harmonywith his vanity, and as such perfectly genuine. He had given hislast dollar to an old woman moaning with the grief and fatigue ofa dismal search under the arch of the ancient gate. Performed inobscurity and without witnesses, it had still the characteristicsof splendour and publicity, and was in strict keeping with hisreputation. But this awakening in solitude, except for thewatchful vulture, amongst the ruins of the fort, had no suchcharacteristics. His first confused feeling was exactlythis--that it was not in keeping. It was more like the end ofthings. The necessity of living concealed somehow, for God knowshow long, which assailed him on his return to consciousness, madeeverything that had gone before for years appear vain andfoolish, like a flattering dream come suddenly to an end.He climbed the crumbling slope of the rampart, and, putting asidethe bushes, looked upon the harbour. He saw a couple of ships atanchor upon the sheet of water reflecting the last gleams oflight, and Sotillo's steamer moored to the jetty. And behind thepale long front of the Custom House, there appeared the extent ofthe town like a grove of thick timber on the plain with a gatewayin front, and the cupolas, towers, and miradors rising above thetrees, all dark, as if surrendered already to the night. Thethought that it was no longer open to him to ride through thestreets, recognized by everyone, great and little, as he used todo every evening on his way to play monte in the posada of theMexican Domingo; or to sit in the place of honour, listening tosongs and looking at dances, made it appear to him as a town thathad no existence.For a long time he gazed on, then let the parted bushes springback, and, crossing over to the other side of the fort, surveyedthe vaster emptiness of the great gulf. The Isabels stood outheavily upon the narrowing long band of red in the west, whichgleamed low between their black shapes, and the Capataz thoughtof Decoud alone there with the treasure. That man was the onlyone who cared whether he fell into the hands of the Monterists ornot, the Capataz reflected bitterly. And that merely would be ananxiety for his own sake. As to the rest, they neither knew norcared. What he had heard Giorgio Viola say once was very true.Kings, ministers, aristocrats, the rich in general, kept thepeople in poverty and subjection; they kept them as they keptdogs, to fight and hunt for their service.The darkness of the sky had descended to the line of the horizon,enveloping the whole gulf, the islets, and the lover of Antoniaalone with the treasure on the Great Isabel. The Capataz, turninghis back on these things invisible and existing, sat down andtook his face between his fists. He felt the pinch of poverty forthe first time in his life. To find himself without money after arun of bad luck at monte in the low, smoky room of Domingo'sposada, where the fraternity of Cargadores gambled, sang, anddanced of an evening; to remain with empty pockets after a burstof public generosity to some peyne d'oro girl or other (for whomhe did not care), had none of the humiliation of destitution.  Heremained rich in glory and reputation. But since it was no longerpossible for him to parade the streets of the town, and be hailedwith respect in the usual haunts of his leisure, this sailor felthimself destitute indeed.His mouth was dry. It was dry with heavy sleep and extremelyanxious thinking, as it had never been dry before. It may be saidthat Nostromo tasted the dust and ashes of the fruit of life intowhich he had bitten deeply in his hunger for praise. Withoutremoving his head from between his fists, he tried to spit beforehim--"Tfui"--and muttered a curse upon the selfishness of all therich people.Since everything seemed lost in Sulaco (and that was the feelingof his waking), the idea of leaving the country altogether hadpresented itself to Nostromo. At that thought he had seen, likethe beginning of another dream, a vision of steep and tidelessshores, with dark pines on the heights and white houses low downnear a very blue sea. He saw the quays of a big port, where thecoasting feluccas, with their lateen sails outspread likemotionless wings, enter gliding silently between the end of longmoles of squared blocks that project angularly towards eachother, hugging a cluster of shipping to the superb bosom of ahill covered with palaces. He remembered these sights not withoutsome filial emotion, though he had been habitually and severelybeaten as a boy on one of these feluccas by a short-necked,shaven Genoese, with a deliberate and distrustful manner, who (hefirmly believed) had cheated him out of his orphan's inheritance.But it is mercifully decreed that the evils of the past shouldappear but faintly in retrospect. Under the sense of loneliness,abandonment, and failure, the idea of return to these thingsappeared tolerable. But, what? Return? With bare feet and head,with one check shirt and a pair of cotton calzoneros for allworldly possessions?The renowned Capataz, his elbows on his knees and a fist dug intoeach cheek, laughed with self-derision, as he had spat withdisgust, straight out before him into the night. The confused andintimate impressions of universal dissolution which beset asubjective nature at any strong check to its ruling passion had abitterness approaching that of death itself. He was simple. Hewas as ready to become the prey of any belief, superstition, ordesire as a child.The facts of his situation he could appreciate like a man with adistinct experience of the country. He saw them clearly. He wasas if sobered after a long bout of intoxication. His fidelity hadbeen taken advantage of. He had persuaded the body of Cargadoresto side with the Blancos against the rest of the people; he hadhad interviews with Don Jose; he had been made use of by FatherCorbelan for negotiating with Hernandez; it was known that DonMartin Decoud had admitted him to a sort of intimacy, so that hehad been free of the offices of the Porvenir. All these thingshad flattered him in the usual way. What did he care about theirpolitics? Nothing at all. And at the end of it all--Nostromohere and Nostromo there--where is Nostromo?  Nostromo can do thisand that--work all day and ride all night--behold! he foundhimself a marked Ribierist for any sort of vengeance Gamacho, forinstance, would choose to take, now the Montero party, had, afterall, mastered the town. The Europeans had given up; theCaballeros had given up. Don Martin had indeed explained it wasonly temporary--that he was going to bring Barrios to therescue. Where was that now--with Don Martin (whose ironic mannerof talk had always made the Capataz feel vaguely uneasy) strandedon the Great Isabel? Everybody had given up. Even Don Carlos hadgiven up. The hurried removal of the treasure out to sea meantnothing else than that. The Capataz de Cargadores, on a revulsionof subjectiveness, exasperated almost to insanity, beheld all hisworld without faith and courage. He had been betrayed!With the boundless shadows of the sea behind him, out of hissilence and immobility, facing the lofty shapes of the lowerpeaks crowded around the white, misty sheen of Higuerota,Nostromo laughed aloud again, sprang abruptly to his feet, andstood still. He must go. But where?"There is no mistake. They keep us and encourage us as if we weredogs born to fight and hunt for them.  The vecchio is right," hesaid, slowly and scathingly.  He remembered old Giorgio takinghis pipe out of his mouth to throw these words over his shoulderat the cafe, full of engine-drivers and fitters from the railwayworkshops. This image fixed his wavering purpose.  He would tryto find old Giorgio if he could. God knows what might havehappened to him! He made a few steps, then stopped again andshook his head.  To the left and right, in front and behind him,the scrubby bush rustled mysteriously in the darkness."Teresa was right, too," he added in a low tone touched with awe.He wondered whether she was dead in her anger with him or stillalive. As if in answer to this thought, half of remorse and halfof hope, with a soft flutter and oblique flight, a big owl, whoseappalling cry: "Ya-acabo! Ya-acabo!--it is finished; it isfinished"--announces calamity and death in the popular belief,drifted vaguely like a large dark ball across his path. In thedownfall of all the realities that made his force, he wasaffected by the superstition, and shuddered slightly. SignoraTeresa must have died, then. It could mean nothing else. The cryof the ill-omened bird, the first sound he was to hear on hisreturn, was a fitting welcome for his betrayed individuality. Theunseen powers which he had offended by refusing to bring a priestto a dying woman were lifting up their voice against him. She wasdead. With admirable and human consistency he referred everythingto himself. She had been a woman of good counsel always.  And thebereaved old Giorgio remained stunned by his loss just as he waslikely to require the advice of his sagacity. The blow wouldrender the dreamy old man quite stupid for a time.As to Captain Mitchell, Nostromo, after the manner of trustedsubordinates, considered him as a person fitted by educationperhaps to sign papers in an office and to give orders, butotherwise of no use whatever, and something of a fool. Thenecessity of winding round his little finger, almost daily, thepompous and testy self-importance of the old seaman had grownirksome with use to Nostromo. At first it had given him an inwardsatisfaction. But the necessity of overcoming small obstaclesbecomes wearisome to a self-confident personality as much by thecertitude of success as by the monotony of effort. He mistrustedhis superior's proneness to fussy action. That old Englishman hadno judgment, he said to himself. It was useless to suppose that,acquainted with the true state of the case, he would keep it tohimself. He would talk of doing impracticable things. Nostromofeared him as one would fear saddling one's self with somepersistent worry. He had no discretion.  He would betray thetreasure. And Nostromo had made up his mind that the treasureshould not be betrayed.The word had fixed itself tenaciously in his intelligence.  Hisimagination had seized upon the clear and simple notion ofbetrayal to account for the dazed feeling of enlightenment as tobeing done for, of having inadvertently gone out of his existenceon an issue in which his personality had not been taken intoaccount.  A man betrayed is a man destroyed. Signora Teresa (mayGod have her soul!) had been right. He had never been taken intoaccount. Destroyed! Her white form sitting up bowed in bed, thefalling black hair, the wide-browed suffering face raised to him,the anger of her denunciations appeared to him now majestic withthe awfulness of inspiration and of death.  For it was not fornothing that the evil bird had uttered its lamentable shriek overhis head. She was dead--may God have her soul!Sharing in the anti-priestly freethought of the masses, his mindused the pious formula from the superficial force of habit, butwith a deep-seated sincerity. The popular mind is incapable ofscepticism; and that incapacity delivers their helpless strengthto the wiles of swindlers and to the pitiless enthusiasms ofleaders inspired by visions of a high destiny. She was dead.  Butwould God consent to receive her soul? She had died withoutconfession or absolution, because he had not been willing tospare her another moment of his time. His scorn of priests aspriests remained; but after all, it was impossible to knowwhether what they affirmed was not true. Power, punishment,pardon, are simple and credible notions. The magnificent Capatazde Cargadores, deprived of certain simple realities, such as theadmiration of women, the adulation of men, the admired publicityof his life, was ready to feel the burden of sacrilegious guiltdescend upon his shoulders.Bareheaded, in a thin shirt and drawers, he felt the lingeringwarmth of the fine sand under the soles of his feet. The narrowstrand gleamed far ahead in a long curve, defining the outline ofthis wild side of the harbour. He flitted along the shore like apursued shadow between the sombre palm-groves and the sheet ofwater lying as still as death on his right hand. He strode withheadlong haste in the silence and solitude as though he hadforgotten all prudence and caution.  But he knew that on thisside of the water he ran no risk of discovery. The onlyinhabitant was a lonely, silent, apathetic Indian in charge ofthe palmarias, who brought sometimes a load of cocoanuts to thetown for sale. He lived without a woman in an open shed, with aperpetual fire of dry sticks smouldering near an old canoe lyingbottom up on the beach.  He could be easily avoided.The barking of the dogs about that man's ranche was the firstthing that checked his speed. He had forgotten the dogs. Heswerved sharply, and plunged into the palm-grove, as into awilderness of columns in an immense hall, whose dense obscurityseemed to whisper and rustle faintly high above his head. Hetraversed it, entered a ravine, and climbed to the top of a steepridge free of trees and bushes.From there, open and vague in the starlight, he saw the plainbetween the town and the harbour. In the woods above somenight-bird made a strange drumming noise. Below beyond thepalmaria on the beach, the Indian's dogs continued to barkuproariously. He wondered what had upset them so much, and,peering down from his elevation, was surprised to detectunaccountable movements of the ground below, as if several oblongpieces of the plain had been in motion.  Those dark, shiftingpatches, alternately catching and eluding the eye, altered theirplace always away from the harbour, with a suggestion ofconsecutive order and purpose. A light dawned upon him. It was acolumn of infantry on a night march towards the higher brokencountry at the foot of the hills. But he was too much in the darkabout everything for wonder and speculation.The plain had resumed its shadowy immobility.  He descended theridge and found himself in the open solitude, between the harbourand the town. Its spaciousness, extended indefinitely by aneffect of obscurity, rendered more sensible his profoundisolation.  His pace became slower. No one waited for him; no onethought of him; no one expected or wished his return.  "Betrayed!Betrayed!" he muttered to himself.  No one cared. He might havebeen drowned by this time. No one would have cared--unless,perhaps, the children, he thought to himself. But they were withthe English signora, and not thinking of him at all.He wavered in his purpose of making straight for the Casa Viola.To what end? What could he expect there? His life seemed to failhim in all its details, even to the scornful reproaches ofTeresa. He was aware painfully of his reluctance. Was it thatremorse which she had prophesied with, what he saw now, was herlast breath?Meantime, he had deviated from the straight course, inclining bya sort of instinct to the right, towards the jetty and theharbour, the scene of his daily labours.  The great length of theCustom House loomed up all at once like the wall of a factory.Not a soul challenged his approach, and his curiosity becameexcited as he passed cautiously towards the front by theunexpected sight of two lighted windows.They had the fascination of a lonely vigil kept by somemysterious watcher up there, those two windows shining dimly uponthe harbour in the whole vast extent of the abandoned building.The solitude could almost be felt. A strong smell of wood smokehung about in a thin haze, which was faintly perceptible to hisraised eyes against the glitter of the stars. As he advanced inthe profound silence, the shrilling of innumerable cicalas in thedry grass seemed positively deafening to his strained ears.Slowly, step by step, he found himself in the great hall, sombreand full of acrid smoke.A fire built against the staircase had burnt down impotently to alow heap of embers. The hard wood had failed to catch; only a fewsteps at the bottom smouldered, with a creeping glow of sparksdefining their charred edges. At the top he saw a streak of lightfrom an open door. It fell upon the vast landing, all foggy witha slow drift of smoke. That was the room. He climbed the stairs,then checked himself, because he had seen within the shadow of aman cast upon one of the walls. It was a shapeless,highshouldered shadow of somebody standing still, with loweredhead, out of his line of sight. The Capataz, remembering that hewas totally unarmed, stepped aside, and, effacing himself uprightin a dark corner, waited with his eyes fixed on the door.The whole enormous ruined barrack of a place, unfinished, withoutceilings under its lofty roof, was pervaded by the smoke swayingto and fro in the faint cross draughts playing in the obscurityof many lofty rooms and barnlike passages. Once one of theswinging shutters came against the wall with a single sharpcrack, as if pushed by an impatient hand. A piece of paperscurried out from somewhere, rustling along the landing.  Theman, whoever he was, did not darken the lighted doorway. Twicethe Capataz, advancing a couple of steps out of his corner,craned his neck in the hope of catching sight of what he could beat, so quietly, in there. But every time he saw only thedistorted shadow of broad shoulders and bowed head.  He was doingapparently nothing, and stirred not from the spot, as though hewere meditating--or, perhaps, reading a paper. And not a soundissued from the room.Once more the Capataz stepped back. He wondered who it was--someMonterist? But he dreaded to show himself. To discover hispresence on shore, unless after many days, would, he believed,endanger the treasure. With his own knowledge possessing hiswhole soul, it seemed impossible that anybody in Sulaco shouldfail to jump at the right surmise. After a couple of weeks or soit would be different. Who could tell he had not returnedoverland from some port beyond the limits of the Republic? Theexistence of the treasure confused his thoughts with a peculiarsort of anxiety, as though his life had become bound up with it.It rendered him timorous for a moment before that enigmatic,lighted door. Devil take the fellow! He did not want to see him.There would be nothing to learn from his face, known or unknown.He was a fool to waste his time there in waiting.Less than five minutes after entering the place the Capataz beganhis retreat. He got away down the stairs with perfect success,gave one upward look over his shoulder at the light on thelanding, and ran stealthily across the hall. But at the verymoment he was turning out of the great door, with his mind fixedupon escaping the notice of the man upstairs, somebody he had notheard coming briskly along the front ran full into him. Bothmuttered a stifled exclamation of surprise, and leaped back andstood still, each indistinct to the other. Nostromo was silent.The other man spoke first, in an amazed and deadened tone."Who are you?"Already Nostromo had seemed to recognize Dr.  Monygham. He had nodoubt now. He hesitated the space of a second. The idea ofbolting without a word presented itself to his mind. No use! Aninexplicable repugnance to pronounce the name by which he wasknown kept him silent a little longer. At last he said in a lowvoice--"A Cargador."He walked up to the other. Dr. Monygham had received a shock. Heflung his arms up and cried out his wonder aloud, forgettinghimself before the marvel of this meeting. Nostromo angrilywarned him to moderate his voice. The Custom House was not sodeserted as it looked. There was somebody in the lighted roomabove.There is no more evanescent quality in an accomplished fact thanits wonderfulness. Solicited incessantly by the considerationsaffecting its fears and desires, the human mind turns naturallyaway from the marvellous side of events. And it was in the mostnatural way possible that the doctor asked this man whom only twominutes before he believed to have been drowned in the gulf--"You have seen somebody up there? Have you?""No, I have not seen him.""Then how do you know?""I was running away from his shadow when we met.""His shadow?""Yes. His shadow in the lighted room," said Nostromo, in acontemptuous tone. Leaning back with folded arms at the foot ofthe immense building, he dropped his head, biting his lipsslightly, and not looking at the doctor. "Now," he thought tohimself, "he will begin asking me about the treasure."But the doctor's thoughts were concerned with an event not asmarvellous as Nostromo's appearance, but in itself much lessclear. Why had Sotillo taken himself off with his whole commandwith this suddenness and secrecy? What did this move portend?However, it dawned upon the doctor that the man upstairs was oneof the officers left behind by the disappointed colonel tocommunicate with him."I believe he is waiting for me," he said."It is possible.""I must see. Do not go away yet, Capataz.""Go away where?" muttered Nostromo.Already the doctor had left him. He remained leaning against thewall, staring at the dark water of the harbour; the shrilling ofcicalas filled his ears. An invincible vagueness coming over histhoughts took from them all power to determine his will."Capataz! Capataz!" the doctor's voice called urgently fromabove.The sense of betrayal and ruin floated upon his sombreindifference as upon a sluggish sea of pitch. But he stepped outfrom under the wall, and, looking up, saw Dr. Monygham leaningout of a lighted window."Come up and see what Sotillo has done. You need not fear the manup here."He answered by a slight, bitter laugh. Fear a man!  The Capatazof the Sulaco Cargadores fear a man!  It angered him that anybodyshould suggest such a thing. It angered him to be disarmed andskulking and in danger because of the accursed treasure, whichwas of so little account to the people who had tied it round hisneck. He could not shake off the worry of it. To Nostromo thedoctor represented all these people. . . . And he had never evenasked after it. Not a word of inquiry about the most desperateundertaking of his life.Thinking these thoughts, Nostromo passed again through thecavernous hall, where the smoke was considerably thinned, andwent up the stairs, not so warm to his feet now, towards thestreak of light at the top.  The doctor appeared in it for amoment, agitated and impatient."Come up! Come up!"At the moment of crossing the doorway the Capataz experienced ashock of surprise. The man had not moved. He saw his shadow inthe same place. He started, then stepped in with a feeling ofbeing about to solve a mystery.It was very simple. For an infinitesimal fraction of a second,against the light of two flaring and guttering candles, through ablue, pungent, thin haze which made his eyes smart, he saw theman standing, as he had imagined him, with his back to the door,casting an enormous and distorted shadow upon the wall. Swifterthan a flash of lightning followed the impression of hisconstrained, toppling attitude--the shoulders projecting forward,the head sunk low upon the breast. Then he distinguished the armsbehind his back, and wrenched so terribly that the two clenchedfists, lashed together, had been forced up higher than theshoulder-blades.  From there his eyes traced in one instantaneousglance the hide rope going upwards from the tied wrists over aheavy beam and down to a staple in the wall. He did not want tolook at the rigid legs, at the feet hanging down nervelessly,with their bare toes some six inches above the floor, to knowthat the man had been given the estrapade till he had swooned.His first impulse was to dash forward and sever the rope at oneblow.  He felt for his knife. He had no knife--not even a knife.He stood quivering, and the doctor, perched on the edge of thetable, facing thoughtfully the cruel and lamentable sight, hischin in his hand, uttered, without stirring--"Tortured--and shot dead through the breast--getting cold."This information calmed the Capataz. One of the candlesflickering in the socket went out. "Who did this?" he asked."Sotillo, I tell you. Who else? Tortured--of course.  But whyshot?" The doctor looked fixedly at Nostromo, who shrugged hisshoulders slightly.  "And mark, shot suddenly, on impulse. It isevident. I wish I had his secret."Nostromo had advanced, and stooped slightly to look. "I seem tohave seen that face somewhere," he muttered. "Who is he?"The doctor turned his eyes upon him again. "I may yet come toenvying his fate. What do you think of that, Capataz, eh?"But Nostromo did not even hear these words. Seizing the remaininglight, he thrust it under the drooping head. The doctor satoblivious, with a lost gaze.  Then the heavy iron candlestick, asif struck out of Nostromo's hand, clattered on the floor."Hullo!" exclaimed the doctor, looking up with a start. He couldhear the Capataz stagger against the table and gasp. In thesudden extinction of the light within, the dead blackness sealingthe window-frames became alive with stars to his sight."Of course, of course," the doctor muttered to himself inEnglish. "Enough to make him jump out of his skin."Nostromo's heart seemed to force itself into his throat.  Hishead swam. Hirsch! The man was Hirsch!  He held on tight to theedge of the table."But he was hiding in the lighter," he almost shouted His voicefell. "In the lighter, and--and--""And Sotillo brought him in," said the doctor. "He is no morestartling to you than you were to me. What I want to know is howhe induced some compassionate soul to shoot him.""So Sotillo knows--" began Nostromo, in a more equable voice."Everything!" interrupted the doctor.The Capataz was heard striking the table with his fist."Everything? What are you saying, there?  Everything? Knoweverything? It is impossible!  Everything?""Of course. What do you mean by impossible? I tell you I haveheard this Hirsch questioned last night, here, in this very room.He knew your name, Decoud's name, and all about the loading ofthe silver. . . .  The lighter was cut in two. He was grovellingin abject terror before Sotillo, but he remembered that much.What do you want more? He knew least about himself.  They foundhim clinging to their anchor. He must have caught at it just asthe lighter went to the bottom.""Went to the bottom?" repeated Nostromo, slowly.  "Sotillobelieves that? Bueno!"The doctor, a little impatiently, was unable to imagine what elsecould anybody believe. Yes, Sotillo believed that the lighter wassunk, and the Capataz de Cargadores, together with Martin Decoudand perhaps one or two other political fugitives, had beendrowned."I told you well, senor doctor," remarked Nostromo at that point,"that Sotillo did not know everything.""Eh? What do you mean?""He did not know I was not dead.""Neither did we.""And you did not care--none of you caballeros on the wharf--onceyou got off a man of flesh and blood like yourselves on a fool'sbusiness that could not end well.""You forget, Capataz, I was not on the wharf. And I did not thinkwell of the business. So you need not taunt me. I tell you what,man, we had but little leisure to think of the dead. Death standsnear behind us all. You were gone.""I went, indeed!" broke in Nostromo. "And for the sake ofwhat--tell me?""Ah! that is your own affair," the doctor said, roughly.  "Do notask me."Their flowing murmurs paused in the dark. Perched on the edge ofthe table with slightly averted faces, they felt their shoulderstouch, and their eyes remained directed towards an upright shapenearly lost in the obscurity of the inner part of the room, thatwith projecting head and shoulders, in ghastly immobility, seemedintent on catching every word."Muy bien!" Nostromo muttered at last. "So be it.  Teresa wasright. It is my own affair.""Teresa is dead," remarked the doctor, absently, while his mindfollowed a new line of thought suggested by what might have beencalled Nostromo's return to life. "She died, the poor woman.""Without a priest?" the Capataz asked, anxiously."What a question! Who could have got a priest for her lastnight?""May God keep her soul!" ejaculated Nostromo, with a gloomy andhopeless fervour which had no time to surprise Dr. Monygham,before, reverting to their previous conversation, he continued ina sinister tone, "Si, senor doctor. As you were saying, it is myown affair. A very desperate affair.""There are no two men in this part of the world that could havesaved themselves by swimming as you have done," the doctor said,admiringly.And again there was silence between those two men.  They wereboth reflecting, and the diversity of their natures made theirthoughts born from their meeting swing afar from each other. Thedoctor, impelled to risky action by his loyalty to the Goulds,wondered with thankfulness at the chain of accident which hadbrought that man back where he would be of the greatest use inthe work of saving the San Tome mine. The doctor was loyal to themine. It presented itself to his fifty-years' old eyes in theshape of a little woman in a soft dress with a long train, with ahead attractively overweighted by a great mass of fair hair andthe delicate preciousness of her inner worth, partaking of a gemand a flower, revealed in every attitude of her person. As thedangers thickened round the San Tome mine this illusion acquiredforce, permanency, and authority. It claimed him at last! Thisclaim, exalted by a spiritual detachment from the usual sanctionsof hope and reward, made Dr. Monygham's thinking, acting,individuality extremely dangerous to himself and to others, allhis scruples vanishing in the proud feeling that his devotion wasthe only thing that stood between an admirable woman and afrightful disaster.It was a sort of intoxication which made him utterly indifferentto Decoud's fate, but left his wits perfectly clear for theappreciation of Decoud's political idea.  It was a good idea--andBarrios was the only instrument of its realization. The doctor'ssoul, withered and shrunk by the shame of a moral disgrace,became implacable in the expansion of its tenderness. Nostromo'sreturn was providential. He did not think of him humanely, as ofa fellow-creature just escaped from the jaws of death. TheCapataz for him was the only possible messenger to Cayta. Thevery man. The doctor's misanthropic mistrust of mankind (thebitterer because based on personal failure) did not lift himsufficiently above common weaknesses. He was under the spell ofan established reputation. Trumpeted by Captain Mitchell, grownin repetition, and fixed in general assent, Nostromo'sfaithfulness had never been questioned by Dr. Monygham as a fact.It was not likely to be questioned now he stood in desperate needof it himself. Dr. Monygham was human; he accepted the popularconception of the Capataz's incorruptibility simply because noword or fact had ever contradicted a mere affirmation. It seemedto be a part of the man, like his whiskers or his teeth. It wasimpossible to conceive him otherwise. The question was whether hewould consent to go on such a dangerous and desperate errand. Thedoctor was observant enough to have become aware from the firstof something peculiar in the man's temper. He was no doubt soreabout the loss of the silver."It will be necessary to take him into my fullest confidence," hesaid to himself, with a certain acuteness of insight into thenature he had to deal with.On Nostromo's side the silence had been full of blackirresolution, anger, and mistrust. He was the first to break it,however."The swimming was no great matter," he said. "It is what wentbefore--and what comes after that--"He did not quite finish what he meant to say, breaking off short,as though his thought had butted against a solid obstacle. Thedoctor's mind pursued its own schemes with Machiavelliansubtlety. He said as sympathetically as he was able--"It is unfortunate, Capataz. But no one would think of blamingyou. Very unfortunate. To begin with, the treasure ought never tohave left the mountain.  But it was Decoud who--however, he isdead. There is no need to talk of him.""No," assented Nostromo, as the doctor paused, "there is no needto talk of dead men. But I am not dead yet.""You are all right. Only a man of your intrepidity could havesaved himself."In this Dr. Monygham was sincere. He esteemed highly theintrepidity of that man, whom he valued but little, beingdisillusioned as to mankind in general, because of the particularinstance in which his own manhood had failed. Having had toencounter singlehanded during his period of eclipse many physicaldangers, he was well aware of the most dangerous element commonto them all: of the crushing, paralyzing sense of humanlittleness, which is what really defeats a man struggling withnatural forces, alone, far from the eyes of his fellows. He waseminently fit to appreciate the mental image he made for himselfof the Capataz, after hours of tension and anxiety, precipitatedsuddenly into an abyss of waters and darkness, without earth orsky, and confronting it not only with an undismayed mind, butwith sensible success. Of course, the man was an incomparableswimmer, that was known, but the doctor judged that this instancetestified to a still greater intrepidity of spirit. It waspleasing to him; he augured well from it for the success of thearduous mission with which he meant to entrust the Capataz somarvellously restored to usefulness.  And in a tone vaguelygratified, he observed--"It must have been terribly dark!""It was the worst darkness of the Golfo," the Capataz assented,briefly. He was mollified by what seemed a sign of some faintinterest in such things as had befallen him, and dropped a fewdescriptive phrases with an affected and curt nonchalance. Atthat moment he felt communicative. He expected the continuance ofthat interest which, whether accepted or rejected, would haverestored to him his personality--the only thing lost in thatdesperate affair. But the doctor, engrossed by a desperateadventure of his own, was terrible in the pursuit of his idea. Helet an exclamation of regret escape him."I could almost wish you had shouted and shown a light."This unexpected utterance astounded the Capataz by its characterof cold-blooded atrocity. It was as much as to say, "I wish youhad shown yourself a coward; I wish you had had your throat cutfor your pains." Naturally he referred it to himself, whereas itrelated only to the silver, being uttered simply and with manymental reservations. Surprise and rage rendered him speechless,and the doctor pursued, practically unheard by Nostromo, whosestirred blood was beating violently in his ears."For I am convinced Sotillo in possession of the silver wouldhave turned short round and made for some small port abroad.Economically it would have been wasteful, but still less wastefulthan having it sunk.  It was the next best thing to having it athand in some safe place, and using part of it to buy up Sotillo.But I doubt whether Don Carlos would have ever made up his mindto it. He is not fit for Costaguana, and that is a fact,Capataz."The Capataz had mastered the fury that was like a tempest in hisears in time to hear the name of Don Carlos. He seemed to havecome out of it a changed man--a man who spoke thoughtfully in asoft and even voice."And would Don Carlos have been content if I had surrendered thistreasure?""I should not wonder if they were all of that way of thinkingnow," the doctor said, grimly. "I was never consulted. Decoud hadit his own way. Their eyes are opened by this time, I shouldthink. I for one know that if that silver turned up this momentmiraculously ashore I would give it to Sotillo. And, as thingsstand, I would be approved.""Turned up miraculously," repeated the Capataz very low; thenraised his voice. "That, senor, would be a greater miracle thanany saint could perform.""I believe you, Capataz," said the doctor, drily.He went on to develop his view of Sotillo's dangerous influenceupon the situation. And the Capataz, listening as if in a dream,felt himself of as little account as the indistinct, motionlessshape of the dead man whom he saw upright under the beam, withhis air of listening also, disregarded, forgotten, like aterrible example of neglect."Was it for an unconsidered and foolish whim that they came tome, then?" he interrupted suddenly.  "Had I not done enough forthem to be of some account, por Dios? Is it that the hombresfinos--the gentlemen--need not think as long as there is a manof the people ready to risk his body and soul? Or, perhaps, wehave no souls--like dogs?""There was Decoud, too, with his plan," the doctor reminded himagain."Si! And the rich man in San Francisco who had something to dowith that treasure, too--what do I know? No! I have heard toomany things. It seems to me that everything is permitted to therich.""I understand, Capataz," the doctor began."What Capataz?" broke in Nostromo, in a forcible but even voice."The Capataz is undone, destroyed.  There is no Capataz. Oh, no!You will find the Capataz no more.""Come, this is childish!" remonstrated the doctor; and the othercalmed down suddenly."I have been indeed like a little child," he muttered.And as his eyes met again the shape of the murdered man suspendedin his awful immobility, which seemed the uncomplainingimmobility of attention, he asked, wondering gently--"Why did Sotillo give the estrapade to this pitiful wretch? Doyou know? No torture could have been worse than his fear. KillingI can understand. His anguish was intolerable to behold. But whyshould he torment him like this? He could tell no more.""No; he could tell nothing more. Any sane man would have seenthat. He had told him everything.  But I tell you what it is,Capataz. Sotillo would not believe what he was told. Noteverything.""What is it he would not believe? I cannot understand.""I can, because I have seen the man. He refuses to believe thatthe treasure is lost.""What?" the Capataz cried out in a discomposed tone."That startles you--eh?""Am I to understand, senor," Nostromo went on in a deliberateand, as it were, watchful tone, "that Sotillo thinks the treasurehas been saved by some means?""No! no! That would be impossible," said the doctor, withconviction; and Nostromo emitted a grunt in the dark. "That wouldbe impossible. He thinks that the silver was no longer in thelighter when she was sunk. He has convinced himself that thewhole show of getting it away to sea is a mere sham got up todeceive Gamacho and his Nationals, Pedrito Montero, SenorFuentes, our new Gefe Politico, and himself, too. Only, he says,he is no such fool.""But he is devoid of sense. He is the greatest imbecile that evercalled himself a colonel in this country of evil," growledNostromo."He is no more unreasonable than many sensible men," said thedoctor. "He has convinced himself that the treasure can be foundbecause he desires passionately to possess himself of it. And heis also afraid of his officers turning upon him and going over toPedrito, whom he has not the courage either to fight or trust. Doyou see that, Capataz? He need fear no desertion as long as somehope remains of that enormous plunder turning up. I have made itmy business to keep this very hope up.""You have?" the Capataz de Cargadores repeated cautiously. "Well,that is wonderful. And how long do you think you are going tokeep it up?""As long as I can.""What does that mean?""I can tell you exactly. As long as I live," the doctor retortedin a stubborn voice. Then, in a few words, he described the storyof his arrest and the circumstances of his release. "I was goingback to that silly scoundrel when we met," he concluded.Nostromo had listened with profound attention.  "You have made upyour mind, then, to a speedy death," he muttered through hisclenched teeth."Perhaps, my illustrious Capataz," the doctor said, testily. "Youare not the only one here who can look an ugly death in theface.""No doubt," mumbled Nostromo, loud enough to be overheard. "Theremay be even more than two fools in this place. Who knows?""And that is my affair," said the doctor, curtly."As taking out the accursed silver to sea was my affair,"retorted Nostromo. "I see. Bueno! Each of us has his reasons. Butyou were the last man I conversed with before I started, and youtalked to me as if I were a fool."Nostromo had a great distaste for the doctor's sardonic treatmentof his great reputation. Decoud's faintly ironic recognition usedto make him uneasy; but the familiarity of a man like Don Martinwas flattering, whereas the doctor was a nobody. He couldremember him a penniless outcast, slinking about the streets ofSulaco, without a single friend or acquaintance, till Don CarlosGould took him into the service of the mine."You may be very wise," he went on, thoughtfully, staring intothe obscurity of the room, pervaded by the gruesome enigma of thetortured and murdered Hirsch.  "But I am not such a fool as whenI started. I have learned one thing since, and that is that youare a dangerous man."Dr. Monygham was too startled to do more than exclaim--"What is it you say?""If he could speak he would say the same thing," pursuedNostromo, with a nod of his shadowy head silhouetted against thestarlit window."I do not understand you," said Dr. Monygham, faintly."No? Perhaps, if you had not confirmed Sotillo in his madness, hewould have been in no haste to give the estrapade to thatmiserable Hirsch."The doctor started at the suggestion. But his devotion, absorbingall his sensibilities, had left his heart steeled against remorseand pity. Still, for complete relief, he felt the necessity ofrepelling it loudly and contemptuously."Bah! You dare to tell me that, with a man like Sotillo. Iconfess I did not give a thought to Hirsch.  If I had it wouldhave been useless. Anybody can see that the luckless wretch wasdoomed from the moment he caught hold of the anchor. He wasdoomed, I tell you! Just as I myself am doomed--most probably."This is what Dr. Monygham said in answer to Nostromo's remark,which was plausible enough to prick his conscience. He was not acallous man. But the necessity, the magnitude, the importance ofthe task he had taken upon himself dwarfed all merely humaneconsiderations. He had undertaken it in a fanatical spirit. Hedid not like it. To lie, to deceive, to circumvent even thebasest of mankind was odious to him.  It was odious to him bytraining, instinct, and tradition.  To do these things in thecharacter of a traitor was abhorrent to his nature and terribleto his feelings. He had made that sacrifice in a spirit ofabasement. He had said to himself bitterly, "I am the only onefit for that dirty work." And he believed this. He was notsubtle. His simplicity was such that, though he had no sort ofheroic idea of seeking death, the risk, deadly enough, to whichhe exposed himself, had a sustaining and comforting effect. Tothat spiritual state the fate of Hirsch presented itself as partof the general atrocity of things. He considered that episodepractically.  What did it mean? Was it a sign of some dangerouschange in Sotillo's delusion? That the man should have beenkilled like this was what the doctor could not understand."Yes. But why shot?" he murmured to himself.Nostromo kept very still.CHAPTER NINEDISTRACTED between doubts and hopes, dismayed by the sound ofbells pealing out the arrival of Pedrito Montero, Sotillo hadspent the morning in battling with his thoughts; a contest towhich he was unequal, from the vacuity of his mind and theviolence of his passions. Disappointment, greed, anger, and fearmade a tumult, in the colonel's breast louder than the din ofbells in the town. Nothing he had planned had come to pass.Neither Sulaco nor the silver of the mine had fallen into hishands. He had performed no military exploit to secure hisposition, and had obtained no enormous booty to make off with.Pedrito Montero, either as friend or foe, filled him with dread.The sound of bells maddened him.Imagining at first that he might be attacked at once, he had madehis battalion stand to arms on the shore.  He walked to and froall the length of the room, stopping sometimes to gnaw thefinger-tips of his right hand with a lurid sideways glare fixedon the floor; then, with a sullen, repelling glance all round, hewould resume his tramping in savage aloofness. His hat,horsewhip, sword, and revolver were lying on the table. Hisofficers, crowding the window giving the view of the town gate,disputed amongst themselves the use of his field-glass boughtlast year on long credit from Anzani.  It passed from hand tohand, and the possessor for the time being was besieged byanxious inquiries."There is nothing; there is nothing to see!" he would repeatimpatiently. There was nothing. And when the picket in the bushes near theCasa Viola had been ordered to fall back upon the main body, nostir of life appeared on the stretch of dusty and arid landbetween the town and the waters of the port. But late in theafternoon a horseman issuing from the gate was made out riding upfearlessly. It was an emissary from Senor Fuentes.  Being allalone he was allowed to come on. Dismounting at the great door hegreeted the silent bystanders with cheery impudence, and beggedto be taken up at once to the "muy valliente" colonel.Senor Fuentes, on entering upon his functions of Gefe Politico,had turned his diplomatic abilities to getting hold of theharbour as well as of the mine. The man he pitched upon tonegotiate with Sotillo was a Notary Public, whom the revolutionhad found languishing in the common jail on a charge of forgingdocuments.  Liberated by the mob along with the other "victims ofBlanco tyranny," he had hastened to offer his services to the newGovernment.He set out determined to display much zeal and eloquence intrying to induce Sotillo to come into town alone for a conferencewith Pedrito Montero. Nothing was further from the colonel'sintentions. The mere fleeting idea of trusting himself into thefamous Pedrito's hands had made him feel unwell several times.It was out of the question--it was madness. And to put himself inopen hostility was madness, too. It would render impossible asystematic search for that treasure, for that wealth of silverwhich he seemed to feel somewhere about, to scent somewhere near.But where? Where? Heavens! Where? Oh! why had he allowed thatdoctor to go! Imbecile that he was.  But no! It was the onlyright course, he reflected distractedly, while the messengerwaited downstairs chatting agreeably to the officers. It was inthat scoundrelly doctor's true interest to return with positiveinformation.  But what if anything stopped him? A generalprohibition to leave the town, for instance! There would bepatrols!The colonel, seizing his head in his hands, turned in his tracksas if struck with vertigo. A flash of craven inspirationsuggested to him an expedient not unknown to European statesmenwhen they wish to delay a difficult negotiation. Booted andspurred, he scrambled into the hammock with undignified haste.His handsome face had turned yellow with the strain of weightycares. The ridge of his shapely nose had grown sharp; theaudacious nostrils appeared mean and pinched.  The velvety,caressing glance of his fine eyes seemed dead, and evendecomposed; for these almond-shaped, languishing orbs had becomeinappropriately bloodshot with much sinister sleeplessness. Headdressed the surprised envoy of Senor Fuentes in a deadened,exhausted voice. It came pathetically feeble from under a pile ofponchos, which buried his elegant person right up to the blackmoustaches, uncurled, pendant, in sign of bodily prostration andmental incapacity. Fever, fever--a heavy fever had overtaken the"muy valliente" colonel. A wavering wildness of expression,caused by the passing spasms of a slight colic which had declareditself suddenly, and the rattling teeth of repressed panic, had agenuineness which impressed the envoy. It was a cold fit. Thecolonel explained that he was unable to think, to listen, tospeak. With an appearance of superhuman effort the colonel gaspedout that he was not in a state to return a suitable reply or toexecute any of his Excellency's orders. But to-morrow!To-morrow! Ah! to-morrow! Let his Excellency Don Pedro be withoutuneasiness. The brave Esmeralda Regiment held the harbour,held--And closing his eyes, he rolled his aching head like ahalf-delirious invalid under the inquisitive stare of the envoy,who was obliged to bend down over the hammock in order to catchthe painful and broken accents. Meantime, Colonel Sotillo trustedthat his Excellency's humanity would permit the doctor, theEnglish doctor, to come out of town with his case of foreignremedies to attend upon him. He begged anxiously his worship thecaballero now present for the grace of looking in as he passedthe Casa Gould, and informing the English doctor, who wasprobably there, that his services were immediately required byColonel Sotillo, lying ill of fever in the Custom House.Immediately. Most urgently required. Awaited with extremeimpatience.  A thousand thanks. He closed his eyes wearily andwould not open them again, lying perfectly still, deaf, dumb,insensible, overcome, vanquished, crushed, annihilated by thefell disease.But as soon as the other had shut after him the door of thelanding, the colonel leaped out with a fling of both feet in anavalanche of woollen coverings. His spurs having become entangledin a perfect welter of ponchos he nearly pitched on his head, anddid not recover his balance till the middle of the room.Concealed behind the half-closed jalousies he listened to whatwent on below.The envoy had already mounted, and turning to the morose officersoccupying the great doorway, took off his hat formally."Caballeros," he said, in a very loud tone, "allow me torecommend you to take great care of your colonel. It has done memuch honour and gratification to have seen you all, a fine bodyof men exercising the soldierly virtue of patience in thisexposed situation, where there is much sun, and no water to speakof, while a town full of wine and feminine charms is ready toembrace you for the brave men you are. Caballeros, I have thehonour to salute you. There will be much dancing to-night inSulaco. Good-bye!"But he reined in his horse and inclined his head sideways onseeing the old major step out, very tall and meagre, in astraight narrow coat coming down to his ankles as it were thecasing of the regimental colours rolled round their staff.The intelligent old warrior, after enunciating in a dogmatic tonethe general proposition that the "world was full of traitors,"went on pronouncing deliberately a panegyric upon Sotillo. Heascribed to him with leisurely emphasis every virtue underheaven, summing it all up in an absurd colloquialism currentamongst the lower class of Occidentals (especially aboutEsmeralda).  "And," he concluded, with a sudden rise in thevoice, "a man of many teeth--'hombre de muchos dientes.' Si,senor. As to us," he pursued, portentous and impressive, "yourworship is beholding the finest body of officers in the Republic,men unequalled for valour and sagacity, 'y hombres de muchosdientes.'""What? All of them?" inquired the disreputable envoy of SenorFuentes, with a faint, derisive smile."Todos. Si, senor," the major affirmed, gravely, with conviction."Men of many teeth."The other wheeled his horse to face the portal resembling thehigh gate of a dismal barn. He raised himself in his stirrups,extended one arm. He was a facetious scoundrel, entertaining forthese stupid Occidentals a feeling of great scorn natural in anative from the central provinces. The folly of Esmeraldiansespecially aroused his amused contempt. He began an oration uponPedro Montero, keeping a solemn countenance. He flourished hishand as if introducing him to their notice. And when he saw everyface set, all the eyes fixed upon his lips, he began to shout asort of catalogue of perfections: "Generous, valorous, affable,profound"--(he snatched off his hat enthusiastically)--"astatesman, an invincible chief of partisans--" He dropped hisvoice startlingly to a deep, hollow note--"and a dentist."He was off instantly at a smart walk; the rigid straddle of hislegs, the turned-out feet, the stiff back, the rakish slant ofthe sombrero above the square, motionless set of the shouldersexpressing an infinite, awe-inspiring impudence.Upstairs, behind the jalousies, Sotillo did not move for a longtime. The audacity of the fellow appalled him. What were hisofficers saying below? They were saying nothing. Completesilence. He quaked. It was not thus that he had imagined himselfat that stage of the expedition. He had seen himself triumphant,unquestioned, appeased, the idol of the soldiers, weighing insecret complacency the agreeable alternatives of power and wealthopen to his choice. Alas! How different! Distracted, restless,supine, burning with fury, or frozen with terror, he felt a dreadas fathomless as the sea creep upon him from every side. Thatrogue of a doctor had to come out with his information.  That wasclear. It would be of no use to him--alone.  He could do nothingwith it. Malediction! The doctor would never come out. He wasprobably under arrest already, shut up together with Don Carlos.He laughed aloud insanely. Ha! ha! ha! ha! It was Pedrito Monterowho would get the information. Ha!  ha! ha! ha!--and the silver.Ha!All at once, in the midst of the laugh, he became motionless andsilent as if turned into stone. He too, had a prisoner. Aprisoner who must, must know the real truth. He would have to bemade to speak. And Sotillo, who all that time had not quiteforgotten Hirsch, felt an inexplicable reluctance at the notionof proceeding to extremities.He felt a reluctance--part of that unfathomable dread that crepton all sides upon him. He remembered reluctantly, too, thedilated eyes of the hide merchant, his contortions, his loud sobsand protestations. It was not compassion or even mere nervoussensibility.  The fact was that though Sotillo did never for amoment believe his story--he could not believe it; nobody couldbelieve such nonsense--yet those accents of despairing truthimpressed him disagreeably. They made him feel sick. And hesuspected also that the man might have gone mad with fear. Alunatic is a hopeless subject.  Bah! A pretence. Nothing but apretence.  He would know how to deal with that.He was working himself up to the right pitch of ferocity. Hisfine eyes squinted slightly; he clapped his hands; a bare-footedorderly appeared noiselessly, a corporal, with his bayonethanging on his thigh and a stick in his hand.The colonel gave his orders, and presently the miserable Hirsch,pushed in by several soldiers, found him frowning awfully in abroad armchair, hat on head, knees wide apart, arms akimbo,masterful, imposing, irresistible, haughty, sublime, terrible.Hirsch, with his arms tied behind his back, had been bundledviolently into one of the smaller rooms. For many hours heremained apparently forgotten, stretched lifelessly on the floor.From that solitude, full of despair and terror, he was torn outbrutally, with kicks and blows, passive, sunk in hebetude. Helistened to threats and admonitions, and afterwards made hisusual answers to questions, with his chin sunk on his breast, hishands tied behind his back, swaying a little in front of Sotillo,and never looking up. When he was forced to hold up his head, bymeans of a bayonet-point prodding him under the chin, his eyeshad a vacant, trance-like stare, and drops of perspiration as bigas peas were seen hailing down the dirt, bruises, and scratchesof his white face. Then they stopped suddenly.Sotillo looked at him in silence. "Will you depart from yourobstinacy, you rogue?" he asked. Already a rope, whose one endwas fastened to Senor Hirsch's wrists, had been thrown over abeam, and three soldiers held the other end, waiting. He made noanswer.  His heavy lower lip hung stupidly. Sotillo made a sign.Hirsch was jerked up off his feet, and a yell of despair andagony burst out in the room, filled the passage of the greatbuildings, rent the air outside, caused every soldier of the campalong the shore to look up at the windows, started some of theofficers in the hall babbling excitedly, with shining eyes;others, setting their lips, looked gloomily at the floor.Sotillo, followed by the soldiers, had left the room.  The sentryon the landing presented arms. Hirsch went on screaming all alonebehind the half-closed jalousies while the sunshine, reflectedfrom the water of the harbour, made an ever-running ripple oflight high up on the wall. He screamed with uplifted eyebrows anda wide-open mouth--incredibly wide, black, enormous, full ofteeth--comical.In the still burning air of the windless afternoon he made thewaves of his agony travel as far as the O. S. N.  Company'soffices. Captain Mitchell on the balcony, trying to make out whatwent on generally, had heard him faintly but distinctly, and thefeeble and appalling sound lingered in his ears after he hadretreated indoors with blanched cheeks. He had been driven offthe balcony several times during that afternoon.Sotillo, irritable, moody, walked restlessly about, heldconsultations with his officers, gave contradictory orders inthis shrill clamour pervading the whole empty edifice.  Sometimesthere would be long and awful silences.  Several times he hadentered the torture-chamber where his sword, horsewhip, revolver,and field-glass were lying on the table, to ask with forcedcalmness, "Will you speak the truth now? No? I can wait." But hecould not afford to wait much longer. That was just it. Everytime he went in and came out with a slam of the door, the sentryon the landing presented arms, and got in return a black,venomous, unsteady glance, which, in reality, saw nothing at all,being merely the reflection of the soul within--a soul of gloomyhatred, irresolution, avarice, and fury.The sun had set when he went in once more. A soldier carried intwo lighted candles and slunk out, shutting the door withoutnoise."Speak, thou Jewish child of the devil! The silver!  The silver,I say! Where is it? Where have you foreign rogues hidden it?Confess or--"A slight quiver passed up the taut rope from the racked limbs,but the body of Senor Hirsch, enterprising business man fromEsmeralda, hung under the heavy beam perpendicular and silent,facing the colonel awfully. The inflow of the night air, cooledby the snows of the Sierra, spread gradually a deliciousfreshness through the close heat of the room."Speak--thief--scoundrel--picaro--or--"Sotillo had seized the riding-whip, and stood with his arm liftedup. For a word, for one little word, he felt he would have knelt,cringed, grovelled on the floor before the drowsy, consciousstare of those fixed eyeballs starting out of the grimy,dishevelled head that drooped very still with its mouth closedaskew. The colonel ground his teeth with rage and struck. Therope vibrated leisurely to the blow, like the long string of apendulum starting from a rest. But no swinging motion wasimparted to the body of Senor Hirsch, the well-known hidemerchant on the coast. With a convulsive effort of the twistedarms it leaped up a few inches, curling upon itself like a fishon the end of a line.  Senor Hirsch's head was flung back on hisstraining throat; his chin trembled. For a moment the rattle ofhis chattering teeth pervaded the vast, shadowy room, where thecandles made a patch of light round the two flames burning sideby side. And as Sotillo, staying his raised hand, waited for himto speak, with the sudden flash of a grin and a straining forwardof the wrenched shoulders, he spat violently into his face.The uplifted whip fell, and the colonel sprang back with a lowcry of dismay, as if aspersed by a jet of deadly venom. Quick asthought he snatched up his revolver, and fired twice. The reportand the concussion of the shots seemed to throw him at once fromungovernable rage into idiotic stupor. He stood with drooping jawand stony eyes. What had he done, Sangre de Dios! What had hedone? He was basely appalled at his impulsive act, sealing forever these lips from which so much was to be extorted. What couldhe say? How could he explain? Ideas of headlong flight somewhere,anywhere, passed through his mind; even the craven and absurdnotion of hiding under the table occurred to his cowardice. Itwas too late; his officers had rushed in tumultuously, in a greatclatter of scabbards, clamouring, with astonishment and wonder.But since they did not immediately proceed to plunge their swordsinto his breast, the brazen side of his character asserteditself. Passing the sleeve of his uniform over his face he pulledhimself together, His truculent glance turned slowly here andthere, checked the noise where it fell; and the stiff body of thelate Senor Hirsch, merchant, after swaying imperceptibly, made ahalf turn, and came to a rest in the midst of awed murmurs anduneasy shuffling.A voice remarked loudly, "Behold a man who will never speakagain." And another, from the back row of faces, timid andpressing, cried out--"Why did you kill him, mi colonel?""Because he has confessed everything," answered Sotillo, with thehardihood of desperation. He felt himself cornered. He brazenedit out on the strength of his reputation with very fair success.His hearers thought him very capable of such an act. They weredisposed to believe his flattering tale. There is no credulity soeager and blind as the credulity of covetousness, which, in itsuniversal extent, measures the moral misery and the intellectualdestitution of mankind.  Ah! he had confessed everything, thisfractious Jew, this bribon. Good! Then he was no longer wanted. Asudden dense guffaw was heard from the senior captain--abig-headed man, with little round eyes and monstrously fat cheekswhich never moved.  The old major, tall and fantastically raggedlike a scarecrow, walked round the body of the late Senor Hirsch,muttering to himself with ineffable complacency that like thisthere was no need to guard against any future treacheries of thatscoundrel. The others stared, shifting from foot to foot, andwhispering short remarks to each other.Sotillo buckled on his sword and gave curt, peremptory orders tohasten the retirement decided upon in the afternoon. Sinister,impressive, his sombrero pulled right down upon his eyebrows, hemarched first through the door in such disorder of mind that heforgot utterly to provide for Dr. Monygham's possible return. Asthe officers trooped out after him, one or two looked backhastily at the late Senor Hirsch, merchant from Esmeralda, leftswinging rigidly at rest, alone with the two burning candles. Inthe emptiness of the room the burly shadow of head and shoulderson the wall had an air of life.Below, the troops fell in silently and moved off by companieswithout drum or trumpet. The old scarecrow major commanded therearguard; but the party he left behind with orders to fire theCustom House (and "burn the carcass of the treacherous Jew whereit hung") failed somehow in their haste to set the staircaseproperly alight. The body of the late Senor Hirsch dwelt alonefor a time in the dismal solitude of the unfinished building,resounding weirdly with sudden slams and clicks of doors andlatches, with rustling scurries of torn papers, and the tremuloussighs that at each gust of wind passed under the high roof. Thelight of the two candles burning before the perpendicular andbreathless immobility of the late Senor Hirsch threw a gleam afarover land and water, like a signal in the night. He remained tostartle Nostromo by his presence, and to puzzle Dr. Monygham bythe mystery of his atrocious end."But why shot?" the doctor again asked himself, audibly. Thistime he was answered by a dry laugh from Nostromo."You seem much concerned at a very natural thing, senor doctor. Iwonder why? It is very likely that before long we shall all getshot one after another, if not by Sotillo, then by Pedrito, orFuentes, or Gamacho.  And we may even get the estrapade, too, orworse--quien sabe?--with your pretty tale of the silver you putinto Sotillo's head.""It was in his head already," the doctor protested.  "I only--""Yes. And you only nailed it there so that the devil himself--""That is precisely what I meant to do," caught up the doctor."That is what you meant to do. Bueno. It is as I say. You are adangerous man."Their voices, which without rising had been growing quarrelsome,ceased suddenly. The late Senor Hirsch, erect and shadowy againstthe stars, seemed to be waiting attentive, in impartial silence.But Dr. Monygham had no mind to quarrel with Nostromo.  At thissupremely critical point of Sulaco's fortunes it was borne uponhim at last that this man was really indispensable, moreindispensable than ever the infatuation of Captain Mitchell, hisproud discoverer, could conceive; far beyond what Decoud's bestdry raillery about "my illustrious friend, the unique Capataz deCargadores," had ever intended. The fellow was unique. He was not"one in a thousand." He was absolutely the only one. The doctorsurrendered.  There was something in the genius of that Genoeseseaman which dominated the destinies of great enterprises and ofmany people, the fortunes of Charles Gould, the fate of anadmirable woman. At this last thought the doctor had to clear histhroat before he could speak.In a completely changed tone he pointed out to the Capataz that,to begin with, he personally ran no great risk. As far aseverybody knew he was dead. It was an enormous advantage. He hadonly to keep out of sight in the Casa Viola, where the oldGaribaldino was known to be alone--with his dead wife. Theservants had all run away. No one would think of searching forhim there, or anywhere else on earth, for that matter."That would be very true," Nostromo spoke up, bitterly, "if I hadnot met you."For a time the doctor kept silent. "Do you mean to say that youthink I may give you away?" he asked in an unsteady voice. "Why?Why should I do that?""What do I know? Why not? To gain a day perhaps.  It would takeSotillo a day to give me the estrapade, and try some other thingsperhaps, before he puts a bullet through my heart--as he did tothat poor wretch here. Why not?"The doctor swallowed with difficulty. His throat had gone dry ina moment. It was not from indignation.  The doctor, patheticallyenough, believed that he had forfeited the right to be indignantwith any one--for anything. It was simple dread. Had the fellowheard his story by some chance? If so, there was an end of hisusefulness in that direction. The indispensable man escaped hisinfluence, because of that indelible blot which made him fit fordirty work. A feeling as of sickness came upon the doctor. Hewould have given anything to know, but he dared not clear up thepoint. The fanaticism of his devotion, fed on the sense of hisabasement, hardened his heart in sadness and scorn."Why not, indeed?" he reechoed, sardonically.  "Then the safething for you is to kill me on the spot.  I would defend myself.But you may just as well know I am going about unarmed.""Por Dios!" said the Capataz, passionately. "You fine people areall alike. All dangerous. All betrayers of the poor who are yourdogs.""You do not understand," began the doctor, slowly."I understand you all!" cried the other with a violent movement,as shadowy to the doctor's eyes as the persistent immobility ofthe late Senor Hirsch. "A poor man amongst you has got to lookafter himself. I say that you do not care for those that serveyou. Look at me! After all these years, suddenly, here I findmyself like one of these curs that bark outside the walls--without a kennel or a dry bone for my teeth. (Caramba!" But herelented with a contemptuous fairness.  "Of course," he went on,quietly, "I do not suppose that you would hasten to give me up toSotillo, for example. It is not that. It is that I am nothing!Suddenly--" He swung his arm downwards. "Nothing to any one," herepeated.The doctor breathed freely. "Listen, Capataz," he said,stretching out his arm almost affectionately towards Nostromo'sshoulder. "I am going to tell you a very simple thing. You aresafe because you are needed. I would not give you away for anyconceivable reason, because I want you."In the dark Nostromo bit his lip. He had heard enough of that. Heknew what that meant. No more of that for him. But he had to lookafter himself now, he thought. And he thought, too, that it wouldnot be prudent to part in anger from his companion. The doctor,admitted to be a great healer, had, amongst the populace ofSulaco, the reputation of being an evil sort of man. It was basedsolidly on his personal appearance, which was strange, and on hisrough ironic manner--proofs visible, sensible, andincontrovertible of the doctor's malevolent disposition. AndNostromo was of the people. So he only grunted incredulously."You, to speak plainly, are the only man," the doctor pursued."It is in your power to save this town and . . . everybody fromthe destructive rapacity of men who--""No, senor," said Nostromo, sullenly. "It is not in my power toget the treasure back for you to give up to Sotillo, or Pedrito,or Gamacho. What do I know?""Nobody expects the impossible," was the answer."You have said it yourself--nobody," muttered Nostromo, in agloomy, threatening tone.But Dr. Monygham, full of hope, disregarded the enigmatic wordsand the threatening tone. To their eyes, accustomed to obscurity,the late Senor Hirsch, growing more distinct, seemed to have comenearer.  And the doctor lowered his voice in exposing his schemeas though afraid of being overheard.He was taking the indispensable man into his fullest confidence.Its implied flattery and suggestion of great risks came with afamiliar sound to the Capataz. His mind, floating in irresolutionand discontent, recognized it with bitterness. He understood wellthat the doctor was anxious to save the San Tome mine fromannihilation.  He would be nothing without it. It was hisinterest. Just as it had been the interest of Senor Decoud, ofthe Blancos, and of the Europeans to get his Cargadores on theirside. His thought became arrested upon Decoud. What would happento him?Nostromo's prolonged silence made the doctor uneasy.  He pointedout, quite unnecessarily, that though for the present he wassafe, he could not live concealed for ever. The choice wasbetween accepting the mission to Barrios, with all its dangersand difficulties, and leaving Sulaco by stealth, ingloriously, inpoverty."None of your friends could reward you and protect you just now,Capataz. Not even Don Carlos himself.""I would have none of your protection and none of your rewards. Ionly wish I could trust your courage and your sense. When Ireturn in triumph, as you say, with Barrios, I may find you alldestroyed. You have the knife at your throat now."It was the doctor's turn to remain silent in the contemplation ofhorrible contingencies."Well, we would trust your courage and your sense.  And you, too,have a knife at your throat.""Ah! And whom am I to thank for that? What are your politics andyour mines to me--your silver and your constitutions--your DonCarlos this, and Don Jose that--""I don't know," burst out the exasperated doctor.  "There areinnocent people in danger whose little finger is worth more thanyou or I and all the Ribierists together. I don't know. Youshould have asked yourself before you allowed Decoud to lead youinto all this. It was your place to think like a man; but if youdid not think then, try to act like a man now.  Did you imagineDecoud cared very much for what would happen to you?""No more than you care for what will happen to me," muttered theother."No; I care for what will happen to you as little as I care forwhat will happen to myself.""And all this because you are such a devoted Ribierist?" Nostromosaid in an incredulous tone."All this because I am such a devoted Ribierist," repeated Dr.Monygham, grimly.Again Nostromo, gazing abstractedly at the body of the late SenorHirsch, remained silent, thinking that the doctor was a dangerousperson in more than one sense.  It was impossible to trust him."Do you speak in the name of Don Carlos?" he asked at last."Yes. I do," the doctor said, loudly, without hesitation.  "Hemust come forward now. He must," he added in a mutter, whichNostromo did not catch."What did you say, senor?"The doctor started. "I say that you must be true to yourself,Capataz. It would be worse than folly to fail now.""True to myself," repeated Nostromo. "How do you know that Iwould not be true to myself if I told you to go to the devil withyour propositions?""I do not know. Maybe you would," the doctor said, with aroughness of tone intended to hide the sinking of his heart andthe faltering of his voice. "All I know is, that you had betterget away from here.  Some of Sotillo's men may turn up herelooking for me."He slipped off the table, listening intently. The Capataz, too,stood up."Suppose I went to Cayta, what would you do meantime?" he asked."I would go to Sotillo directly you had left--in the way I amthinking of.""A very good way--if only that engineer-in-chief consents. Remindhim, senor, that I looked after the old rich Englishman who paysfor the railway, and that I saved the lives of some of his peoplethat time when a gang of thieves came from the south to wreck oneof his pay-trains. It was I who discovered it all at the risk ofmy life, by pretending to enter into their plans. Just as you aredoing with Sotillo.""Yes. Yes, of course. But I can offer him better arguments," thedoctor said, hastily. " Leave it to me.""Ah, yes! True. I am nothing.""Not at all. You are everything."They moved a few paces towards the door. Behind them the lateSenor Hirsch preserved the immobility of a disregarded man."That will be all right. I know what to say to the engineer,"pursued the doctor, in a low tone. "My difficulty will be withSotillo."And Dr. Monygham stopped short in the doorway as if intimidatedby the difficulty. He had made the sacrifice of his life. Heconsidered this a fitting opportunity.  But he did not want tothrow his life away too soon.  In his quality of betrayer of DonCarlos' confidence, he would have ultimately to indicate thehiding-place of the treasure. That would be the end of hisdeception, and the end of himself as well, at the hands of theinfuriated colonel. He wanted to delay him to the very lastmoment; and he had been racking his brains to invent some placeof concealment at once plausible and difficult of access.He imparted his trouble to Nostromo, and concluded--"Do you know what, Capataz? I think that when the time comes andsome information must be given, I shall indicate the GreatIsabel. That is the best place I can think of. What is thematter?"A low exclamation had escaped Nostromo.  The doctor waited,surprised, and after a moment of profound silence, heard a thickvoice stammer out, "Utter folly," and stop with a gasp."Why folly?""Ah! You do not see it," began Nostromo, scathingly, gatheringscorn as he went on. "Three men in half an hour would see that noground had been disturbed anywhere on that island. Do you thinkthat such a treasure can be buried without leaving traces of thework--eh! senor doctor? Why! you would not gain half a day morebefore having your throat cut by Sotillo. The Isabel! Whatstupidity! What miserable invention! Ah! you are all alike, youfine men of intelligence. All you are fit for is to betray men ofthe people into undertaking deadly risks for objects that you arenot even sure about. If it comes off you get the benefit. If not,then it does not matter. He is only a dog. Ah! Madre de Dios, Iwould--" He shook his fists above his head.The doctor was overwhelmed at first by this fierce, hissingvehemence."Well! It seems to me on your own showing that the men of thepeople are no mean fools, too," he said, sullenly.  "No, butcome. You are so clever. Have you a better place?"Nostromo had calmed down as quickly as he had flared up."I am clever enough for that," he said, quietly, almost withindifference. "You want to tell him of a hiding-place big enoughto take days in ransacking--a place where a treasure of silveringots can be buried without leaving a sign on the surface.""And close at hand," the doctor put in."Just so, senor. Tell him it is sunk.""This has the merit of being the truth," the doctor said,contemptuously. "He will not believe it.""You tell him that it is sunk where he may hope to lay his handson it, and he will believe you quick enough.  Tell him it hasbeen sunk in the harbour in order to be recovered afterwards bydivers. Tell him you found out that I had orders from Don CarlosGould to lower the cases quietly overboard somewhere in a linebetween the end of the jetty and the entrance. The depth is nottoo great there. He has no divers, but he has a ship, boats,ropes, chains, sailors--of a sort. Let him fish for the silver.Let him set his fools to drag backwards and forwards andcrossways while he sits and watches till his eyes drop out of hishead.""Really, this is an admirable idea," muttered the doctor."Si. You tell him that, and see whether he will not believe you!He will spend days in rage and torment--and still he willbelieve. He will have no thought for anything else. He will notgive up till he is driven off--why, he may even forget to killyou. He will neither eat nor sleep. He--""The very thing! The very thing!" the doctor repeated in anexcited whisper. "Capataz, I begin to believe that you are agreat genius in your way."Nostromo had paused; then began again in a changed tone, sombre,speaking to himself as though he had forgotten the doctor'sexistence."There is something in a treasure that fastens upon a man's mind.He will pray and blaspheme and still persevere, and will cursethe day he ever heard of it, and will let his last hour come uponhim unawares, still believing that he missed it only by a foot.He will see it every time he closes his eyes. He will neverforget it till he is dead--and even then----Doctor, did you everhear of the miserable gringos on Azuera, that cannot die? Ha! ha!Sailors like myself. There is no getting away from a treasurethat once fastens upon your mind.""You are a devil of a man, Capataz. It is the most plausiblething."Nostromo pressed his arm."It will be worse for him than thirst at sea or hunger in a townfull of people. Do you know what that is?  He shall suffergreater torments than he inflicted upon that terrified wretch whohad no invention. None!  none! Not like me. I could have toldSotillo a deadly tale for very little pain."He laughed wildly and turned in the doorway towards the body ofthe late Senor Hirsch, an opaque long blotch in thesemi-transparent obscurity of the room between the two tallparallelograms of the windows full of stars."You man of fear!" he cried. "You shall be avenged byme--Nostromo. Out of my way, doctor! Stand aside--or, by thesuffering soul of a woman dead without confession, I willstrangle you with my two hands."He bounded downwards into the black, smoky hall.  With a grunt ofastonishment, Dr. Monygham threw himself recklessly into thepursuit. At the bottom of the charred stairs he had a fall,pitching forward on his face with a force that would have stunneda spirit less intent upon a task of love and devotion. He was upin a moment, jarred, shaken, with a queer impression of theterrestrial globe having been flung at his head in the dark. Butit wanted more than that to stop Dr.  Monygham's body, possessedby the exaltation of self-sacrifice; a reasonable exaltation,determined not to lose whatever advantage chance put into itsway. He ran with headlong, tottering swiftness, his arms goinglike a windmill in his effort to keep his balance on his crippledfeet. He lost his hat; the tails of his open gaberdine flewbehind him. He had no mind to lose sight of the indispensableman. But it was a long time, and a long way from the CustomHouse, before he managed to seize his arm from behind, roughly,out of breath."Stop! Are you mad?"Already Nostromo was walking slowly, his head dropping, as ifchecked in his pace by the weariness of irresolution."What is that to you? Ah! I forgot you want me for something.Always. Siempre Nostromo.""What do you mean by talking of strangling me?" panted thedoctor."What do I mean? I mean that the king of the devils himself hassent you out of this town of cowards and talkers to meet meto-night of all the nights of my life."Under the starry sky the Albergo d'ltalia Una emerged, black andlow, breaking the dark level of the plain. Nostromo stoppedaltogether."The priests say he is a tempter, do they not?" he added, throughhis clenched teeth."My good man, you drivel. The devil has nothing to do with this.Neither has the town, which you may call by what name you please.But Don Carlos Gould is neither a coward nor an empty talker. Youwill admit that?" He waited. "Well?""Could I see Don Carlos?""Great heavens! No! Why? What for?" exclaimed the doctor inagitation. "I tell you it is madness. I will not let you go intothe town for anything.""I must.""You must not!" hissed the doctor, fiercely, almost besidehimself with the fear of the man doing away with his usefulnessfor an imbecile whim of some sort. "I tell you you shall not. Iwould rather----"He stopped at loss for words, feeling fagged out, powerless,holding on to Nostromo's sleeve, absolutely for support after hisrun."I am betrayed!" muttered the Capataz to himself; and the doctor,who overheard the last word, made an effort to speak calmly."That is exactly what would happen to you. You would bebetrayed."He thought with a sickening dread that the man was so well knownthat he could not escape recognition.  The house of the SenorAdministrador was beset by spies, no doubt. And even the veryservants of the casa were not to be trusted. "Reflect, Capataz,"he said, impressively. . . . "What are you laughing at?""I am laughing to think that if somebody that did not approve ofmy presence in town, for instance--you understand, senordoctor--if somebody were to give me up to Pedrito, it would notbe beyond my power to make friends even with him. It is true.What do you think of that?""You are a man of infinite resource, Capataz," said Dr. Monygham,dismally. "I recognize that. But the town is full of talk aboutyou; and those few Cargadores that are not in hiding with therailway people have been shouting 'Viva Montero' on the Plaza allday.""My poor Cargadores!" muttered Nostromo. "Betrayed!  Betrayed!""I understand that on the wharf you were pretty free in layingabout you with a stick amongst your poor Cargadores," the doctorsaid in a grim tone, which showed that he was recovering from hisexertions.  "Make no mistake. Pedrito is furious at SenorRibiera's rescue, and at having lost the pleasure of shootingDecoud. Already there are rumours in the town of the treasurehaving been spirited away. To have missed that does not pleasePedrito either; but let me tell you that if you had all thatsilver in your hand for ransom it would not save you."Turning swiftly, and catching the doctor by the shoulders,Nostromo thrust his face close to his."Maladetta! You follow me speaking of the treasure.  You havesworn my ruin. You were the last man who looked upon me before Iwent out with it. And Sidoni the engine-driver says you have anevil eye.""He ought to know. I saved his broken leg for him last year," thedoctor said, stoically. He felt on his shoulders the weight ofthese hands famed amongst the populace for snapping thick ropesand bending horseshoes.  "And to you I offer the best means ofsaving yourself--let me go--and of retrieving your greatreputation.  You boasted of making the Capataz de Cargadoresfamous from one end of America to the other about this wretchedsilver. But I bring you a better opportunity--let me go, hombre!"Nostromo released him abruptly, and the doctor feared that theindispensable man would run off again.  But he did not. He walkedon slowly. The doctor hobbled by his side till, within a stone'sthrow from the Casa Viola, Nostromo stopped again.Silent in inhospitable darkness, the Casa Viola seemed to havechanged its nature; his home appeared to repel him with an air ofhopeless and inimical mystery. The doctor said--"You will be safe there. Go in, Capataz.""How can I go in?" Nostromo seemed to ask himself in a low,inward tone. "She cannot unsay what she said, and I cannot undowhat I have done.""I tell you it is all right. Viola is all alone in there.  Ilooked in as I came out of the town. You will be perfectly safein that house till you leave it to make your name famous on theCampo. I am going now to arrange for your departure with theengineer-in-chief, and I shall bring you news here long beforedaybreak."Dr. Monygham, disregarding, or perhaps fearing to penetrate themeaning of Nostromo's silence, clapped him lightly on theshoulder, and starting off with his smart, lame walk, vanishedutterly at the third or fourth hop in the direction of therailway track. Arrested between the two wooden posts for peopleto fasten their horses to, Nostromo did not move, as if he, too,had been planted solidly in the ground. At the end of half anhour he lifted his head to the deep baying of the dogs at therailway yards, which had burst out suddenly, tumultuous anddeadened as if coming from under the plain. That lame doctor withthe evil eye had got there pretty fast.Step by step Nostromo approached the Albergo d'Italia Una, whichhe had never known so lightless, so silent, before. The door, allblack in the pale wall, stood open as he had left it twenty-fourhours before, when he had nothing to hide from the world. Heremained before it, irresolute, like a fugitive, like a manbetrayed. Poverty, misery, starvation! Where had he heard thesewords? The anger of a dying woman had prophesied that fate forhis folly. It looked as if it would come true very quickly. Andthe leperos would laugh--she had said. Yes, they would laugh ifthey knew that the Capataz de Cargadores was at the mercy of themad doctor whom they could remember, only a few years ago, buyingcooked food from a stall on the Plaza for a copper coin--like oneof themselves.At that moment the notion of seeking Captain Mitchell passedthrough his mind. He glanced in the direction of the jetty andsaw a small gleam of light in the O.S.N. Company's building. Thethought of lighted windows was not attractive. Two lightedwindows had decoyed him into the empty Custom House, only to fallinto the clutches of that doctor. No! He would not go nearlighted windows again on that night.  Captain Mitchell was there.And what could he be told? That doctor would worm it all out ofhim as if he were a child.On the threshold he called out "Giorgio!" in an undertone. Nobodyanswered. He stepped in. "Ola!  viejo! Are you there? . . ." Inthe impenetrable darkness his head swam with the illusion thatthe obscurity of the kitchen was as vast as the Placid Gulf, andthat the floor dipped forward like a sinking lighter.  "Ola!viejo!" he repeated, falteringly, swaying where he stood. Hishand, extended to steady himself, fell upon the table. Moving astep forward, he shifted it, and felt a box of matches under hisfingers. He fancied he had heard a quiet sigh. He listened for amoment, holding his breath; then, with trembling hands, tried tostrike a light.The tiny piece of wood flamed up quite blindingly at the end ofhis fingers, raised above his blinking eyes.  A concentratedglare fell upon the leonine white head of old Giorgio against theblack fire-place--showed him leaning forward in a chair instaring immobility, surrounded, overhung, by great masses ofshadow, his legs crossed, his cheek in his hand, an empty pipe inthe corner of his mouth. It seemed hours before he attempted toturn his face; at the very moment the match went out, and hedisappeared, overwhelmed by the shadows, as if the walls and roofof the desolate house had collapsed upon his white head inghostly silence.Nostromo heard him stir and utter dispassionately the words--"It may have been a vision.""No," he said, softly. "It is no vision, old man."A strong chest voice asked in the dark--"Is that you I hear, Giovann' Battista?""Si, viejo. Steady. Not so loud."After his release by Sotillo, Giorgio Viola, attended to the verydoor by the good-natured engineer-in-chief, had reentered hishouse, which he had been made to leave almost at the very momentof his wife's death.  All was still. The lamp above was burning.He nearly called out to her by name; and the thought that no callfrom him would ever again evoke the answer of her voice, made himdrop heavily into the chair with a loud groan, wrung out by thepain as of a keen blade piercing his breast.The rest of the night he made no sound. The darkness turned togrey, and on the colourless, clear, glassy dawn the jagged sierrastood out flat and opaque, as if cut out of paper.The enthusiastic and severe soul of Giorgio Viola, sailor,champion of oppressed humanity, enemy of kings, and, by the graceof Mrs. Gould, hotel-keeper of the Sulaco harbour, had descendedinto the open abyss of desolation amongst the shattered vestigesof his past.  He remembered his wooing between two campaigns, asingle short week in the season of gathering olives.  Nothingapproached the grave passion of that time but the deep,passionate sense of his bereavement. He discovered all the extentof his dependence upon the silenced voice of that woman. It washer voice that he missed. Abstracted, busy, lost in inwardcontemplation, he seldom looked at his wife in those later years.The thought of his girls was a matter of concern, not ofconsolation. It was her voice that he would miss.  And heremembered the other child--the little boy who died at sea. Ah! aman would have been something to lean upon. And, alas! even Gian'Battista--he of whom, and of Linda, his wife had spoken to him soanxiously before she dropped off into her last sleep on earth, heon whom she had called aloud to save the children, just beforeshe died--even he was dead!And the old man, bent forward, his head in his hand, sat throughthe day in immobility and solitude. He never heard the brazenroar of the bells in town. When it ceased the earthenware filterin the corner of the kitchen kept on its swift musical drip, dripinto the great porous jar below.Towards sunset he got up, and with slow movements disappeared upthe narrow staircase. His bulk filled it; and the rubbing of hisshoulders made a small noise as of a mouse running behind theplaster of a wall. While he remained up there the house was asdumb as a grave.  Then, with the same faint rubbing noise, hedescended.  He had to catch at the chairs and tables to regainhis seat. He seized his pipe off the high mantel of thefire-place--but made no attempt to reach the tobacco--thrust itempty into the corner of his mouth, and sat down again in thesame staring pose. The sun of Pedrito's entry into Sulaco, thelast sun of Senor Hirsch's life, the first of Decoud's solitudeon the Great Isabel, passed over the Albergo d'ltalia Una on itsway to the west. The tinkling drip, drip of the filter hadceased, the lamp upstairs had burnt itself out, and the nightbeset Giorgio Viola and his dead wife with its obscurity andsilence that seemed invincible till the Capataz de Cargadores,returning from the dead, put them to flight with the splutter andflare of a match."Si, viejo. It is me. Wait."Nostromo, after barricading the door and closing the shutterscarefully, groped upon a shelf for a candle, and lit it.Old Viola had risen. He followed with his eyes in the dark thesounds made by Nostromo. The light disclosed him standing withoutsupport, as if the mere presence of that man who was loyal,brave, incorruptible, who was all his son would have been, wereenough for the support of his decaying strength.He extended his hand grasping the briar-wood pipe, whose bowl wascharred on the edge, and knitted his bushy eyebrows heavily atthe light."You have returned," he said, with shaky dignity.  "Ah! Verywell! I----"He broke off.  Nostromo, leaning back against the table, his armsfolded on his breast, nodded at him slightly."You thought I was drowned! No! The best dog of the rich, of thearistocrats, of these fine men who can only talk and betray thepeople, is not dead yet."The Garibaldino, motionless, seemed to drink in the sound of thewell-known voice. His head moved slightly once as if in sign ofapproval; but Nostromo saw clearly that the old man understoodnothing of the words. There was no one to understand; no one hecould take into the confidence of Decoud's fate, of his own, intothe secret of the silver. That doctor was an enemy of thepeople--a tempter. . . .Old Giorgio's heavy frame shook from head to foot with the effortto overcome his emotion at the sight of that man, who had sharedthe intimacies of his domestic life as though he had been agrown-up son."She believed yon would return," he said, solemnly.Nostromo raised his head."She was a wise woman. How could I fail to come back----?"He finished the thought mentally: "Since she has prophesied forme an end of poverty, misery, and starvation." These words ofTeresa's anger, from the circumstances in which they had beenuttered, like the cry of a soul prevented from making its peacewith God, stirred the obscure superstition of personal fortunefrom which even the greatest genius amongst men of adventure andaction is seldom free. They reigned over Nostromo's mind with theforce of a potent malediction. And what a curse it was that whichher words had laid upon him! He had been orphaned so young thathe could remember no other woman whom he called mother.Henceforth there would be no enterprise in which he would notfail. The spell was working already. Death itself would elude himnow. . . .  He said violently--"Come, viejo! Get me something to eat. I am hungry! Sangre deDios! The emptiness of my belly makes me lightheaded."With his chin dropped again upon his bare breast above his foldedarms, barefooted, watching from under a gloomy brow the movementsof old Viola foraging amongst the cupboards, he seemed as ifindeed fallen under a curse--a ruined and sinister Capataz.Old Viola walked out of a dark corner, and, without a word,emptied upon the table out of his hollowed palms a few dry crustsof bread and half a raw onion.While the Capataz began to devour this beggar's fare, taking upwith stony-eyed voracity piece after piece lying by his side, theGaribaldino went off, and squatting down in another corner filledan earthenware mug with red wine out of a wicker-covereddemijohn.  With a familiar gesture, as when serving customers inthe cafe, he had thrust his pipe between his teeth to have hishands free.The Capataz drank greedily. A slight flush deepened the bronze ofhis cheek. Before him, Viola, with a turn of his white andmassive head towards the staircase, took his empty pipe out ofhis mouth, and pronounced slowly--"After the shot was fired down here, which killed her as surelyas if the bullet had struck her oppressed heart, she called uponyou to save the children. Upon you, Gian' Battista."The Capataz looked up."Did she do that, Padrone? To save the children!  They are withthe English senora, their rich benefactress.  Hey! old man of thepeople. Thy benefactress.  . . .""I am old," muttered Giorgio Viola. "An Englishwoman was allowedto give a bed to Garibaldi lying wounded in prison. The greatestman that ever lived.  A man of the people, too--a sailor. I maylet another keep a roof over my head. Si . . . I am old. I maylet her. Life lasts too long sometimes.""And she herself may not have a roof over her head before manydays are out, unless I . . . What do you say? Am I to keep a roofover her head? Am I to try--and save all the Blancos togetherwith her?""You shall do it," said old Viola in a strong voice.  "You shalldo it as my son would have. . . .""Thy son, viejo! .. .. There never has been a man like thy son.Ha, I must try. . . . But what if it were only a part of thecurse to lure me on? . . .  And so she called upon me tosave--and then----?""She spoke no more." The heroic follower of Garibaldi, at thethought of the eternal stillness and silence fallen upon theshrouded form stretched out on the bed upstairs, averted his faceand raised his hand to his furrowed brow. "She was dead before Icould seize her hands," he stammered out, pitifully.Before the wide eyes of the Capataz, staring at the doorway ofthe dark staircase, floated the shape of the Great Isabel, like astrange ship in distress, freighted with enormous wealth and thesolitary life of a man.  It was impossible for him to doanything. He could only hold his tongue, since there was no oneto trust.  The treasure would be lost, probably--unless Decoud.. . . And his thought came abruptly to an end.  He perceived thathe could not imagine in the least what Decoud was likely to do.Old Viola had not stirred. And the motionless Capataz dropped hislong, soft eyelashes, which gave to the upper part of his fierce,black-whiskered face a touch of feminine ingenuousness. Thesilence had lasted for a long time."God rest her soul!" he murmured, gloomily.CHAPTER TENTHE next day was quiet in the morning, except for the faint soundof firing to the northward, in the direction of Los Hatos.Captain Mitchell had listened to it from his balcony anxiously.The phrase, "In my delicate position as the only consular agentthen in the port, everything, sir, everything was a just causefor anxiety," had its place in the more or less stereotypedrelation of the "historical events" which for the next few yearswas at the service of distinguished strangers visiting Sulaco.The mention of the dignity and neutrality of the flag, sodifficult to preserve in his position, "right in the thick ofthese events between the lawlessness of that piratical villainSotillo and the more regularly established but scarcely lessatrocious tyranny of his Excellency Don Pedro Montero," came nextin order. Captain Mitchell was not the man to enlarge upon meredangers much. But he insisted that it was a memorable day.  Onthat day, towards dusk, he had seen "that poor fellow ofmine--Nostromo. The sailor whom I discovered, and, I may say,made, sir. The man of the famous ride to Cayta, sir. Anhistorical event, sir!"Regarded by the O. S. N. Company as an old and faithful servant,Captain Mitchell was allowed to attain the term of his usefulnessin ease and dignity at the head of the enormously extendedservice. The augmentation of the establishment, with its crowdsof clerks, an office in town, the old office in the harbour, thedivision into departments--passenger, cargo, lighterage, and soon--secured a greater leisure for his last years in theregenerated Sulaco, the capital of the Occidental Republic.Liked by the natives for his good nature and the formality of hismanner, self-important and simple, known for years as a "friendof our country," he felt himself a personality of mark in thetown. Getting up early for a turn in the market-place while thegigantic shadow of Higuerota was still lying upon the fruit andflower stalls piled up with masses of gorgeous colouring,attending easily to current affairs, welcomed in houses, greetedby ladies on the Alameda, with his entry into all the clubs and afooting in the Casa Gould, he led his privileged old bachelor,man-about-town existence with great comfort and solemnity. But onmail-boat days he was down at the Harbour Office at an earlyhour, with his own gig, manned by a smart crew in white and blue,ready to dash off and board the ship directly she showed her bowsbetween the harbour heads.It would be into the Harbour Office that he would lead someprivileged passenger he had brought off in his own boat, andinvite him to take a seat for a moment while he signed a fewpapers. And Captain Mitchell, seating himself at his desk, wouldkeep on talking hospitably--"There isn't much time if you are to see everything in a day. Weshall be off in a moment. We'll have lunch at the AmarillaClub--though I belong also to the Anglo-American--miningengineers and business men, don't you know--and to theMirliflores as well, a new club--English, French, Italians, allsorts--lively young fellows mostly, who wanted to pay acompliment to an old resident, sir. But we'll lunch at theAmarilla.  Interest you, I fancy. Real thing of the country. Menof the first families. The President of the Occidental Republichimself belongs to it, sir. Fine old bishop with a broken nose inthe patio. Remarkable piece of statuary, I believe. CavaliereParrochetti--you know Parrochetti, the famous Italiansculptor--was working here for two years--thought very highly ofour old bishop. . . . There! I am very much at your service now."Proud of his experience, penetrated by the sense of historicalimportance of men, events, and buildings, he talked pompously injerky periods, with slight sweeps of his short, thick arm,letting nothing "escape the attention" of his privileged captive."Lot of building going on, as you observe. Before the Separationit was a plain of burnt grass smothered in clouds of dust, withan ox-cart track to our Jetty.  Nothing more. This is the HarbourGate. Picturesque, is it not? Formerly the town stopped shortthere.  We enter now the Calle de la Constitucion. Observe theold Spanish houses. Great dignity. Eh? I suppose it's just as itwas in the time of the Viceroys, except for the pavement. Woodblocks now. Sulaco National Bank there, with the sentry boxeseach side of the gate. Casa Avellanos this side, with all theground-floor windows shuttered. A wonderful woman livesthere--Miss Avellanos--the beautiful Antonia.  A character, sir!A historical woman! Opposite--Casa Gould. Noble gateway. Yes,the Goulds of the original Gould Concession, that all the worldknows of now. I hold seventeen of the thousand-dollar shares inthe Consolidated San Tome mines. All the poor savings of mylifetime, sir, and it will be enough to keep me in comfort to theend of my days at home when I retire. I got in on theground-floor, you see.  Don Carlos, great friend of mine.Seventeen shares--quite a little fortune to leave behind one,too. I have a niece--married a parson--most worthy man, incumbentof a small parish in Sussex; no end of children. I was nevermarried myself. A sailor should exercise self-denial. Standingunder that very gateway, sir, with some young engineer-fellows,ready to defend that house where we had received so much kindnessand hospitality, I saw the first and last charge of Pedrito'shorsemen upon Barrios's troops, who had just taken the HarbourGate. They could not stand the new rifles brought out by thatpoor Decoud. It was a murderous fire. In a moment the streetbecame blocked with a mass of dead men and horses. They nevercame on again."And all day Captain Mitchell would talk like this to his more orless willing victim--"The Plaza. I call it magnificent. Twice the area of TrafalgarSquare."From the very centre, in the blazing sunshine, he pointed out thebuildings--"The Intendencia, now President's Palace--Cabildo, where theLower Chamber of Parliament sits. You notice the new houses onthat side of the Plaza? Compania Anzani, a great general store,like those cooperative things at home. Old Anzani was murdered bythe National Guards in front of his safe. It was even for thatspecific crime that the deputy Gamacho, commanding the Nationals,a bloodthirsty and savage brute, was executed publicly bygarrotte upon the sentence of a court-martial ordered by Barrios.Anzani's nephews converted the business into a company.  All thatside of the Plaza had been burnt; used to be colonnaded before. Aterrible fire, by the light of which I saw the last of thefighting, the llaneros flying, the Nationals throwing their armsdown, and the miners of San Tome, all Indians from the Sierra,rolling by like a torrent to the sound of pipes and cymbals,green flags flying, a wild mass of men in white ponchos and greenhats, on foot, on mules, on donkeys. Such a sight, sir, willnever be seen again. The miners, sir, had marched upon the town,Don Pepe leading on his black horse, and their very wives in therear on burros, screaming encouragement, sir, and beatingtambourines. I remember one of these women had a green parrotseated on her shoulder, as calm as a bird of stone. They had justsaved their Senor Administrador; for Barrios, though he orderedthe assault at once, at night, too, would have been too late.Pedrito Montero had Don Carlos led out to be shot--like his unclemany years ago--and then, as Barrios said afterwards, 'Sulacowould not have been worth fighting for.' Sulaco without theConcession was nothing; and there were tons and tons of dynamitedistributed all over the mountain with detonators arranged, andan old priest, Father Roman, standing by to annihilate the SanTome mine at the first news of failure. Don Carlos had made uphis mind not to leave it behind, and he had the right men to seeto it, too."Thus Captain Mitchell would talk in the middle of the Plaza,holding over his head a white umbrella with a green lining; butinside the cathedral, in the dim light, with a faint scent ofincense floating in the cool atmosphere, and here and there akneeling female figure, black or all white, with a veiled head,his lowered voice became solemn and impressive."Here," he would say, pointing to a niche in the wall of thedusky aisle, "you see the bust of Don Jose Avellanos, 'Patriotand Statesman,' as the inscription says, 'Minister to Courts ofEngland and Spain, etc., etc., died in the woods of Los Hatosworn out with his lifelong struggle for Right and Justice at thedawn of the New Era.' A fair likeness. Parrochetti's work fromsome old photographs and a pencil sketch by Mrs.  Gould. I waswell acquainted with that distinguished Spanish-American of theold school, a true Hidalgo, beloved by everybody who knew him.The marble medallion in the wall, in the antique style,representing a veiled woman seated with her hands clasped looselyover her knees, commemorates that unfortunate young gentleman whosailed out with Nostromo on that fatal night, sir. See, 'To thememory of Martin Decoud, his betrothed Antonia Avellanos.' Frank,simple, noble. There you have that lady, sir, as she is. Anexceptional woman. Those who thought she would give way todespair were mistaken, sir. She has been blamed in many quartersfor not having taken the veil.  It was expected of her. But DonaAntonia is not the stuff they make nuns of. Bishop Corbelan, heruncle, lives with her in the Corbelan town house. He is a fiercesort of priest, everlastingly worrying the Government about theold Church lands and convents. I believe they think a lot of himin Rome. Now let us go to the Amarilla Club, just across thePlaza, to get some lunch."Directly outside the cathedral on the very top of the nobleflight of steps, his voice rose pompously, his arm found againits sweeping gesture."Porvenir, over there on that first floor, above those Frenchplate-glass shop-fronts; our biggest daily. Conservative, or,rather, I should say, Parliamentary. We have the Parliamentaryparty here of which the actual Chief of the State, Don JusteLopez, is the head; a very sagacious man, I think. A first-rateintellect, sir. The Democratic party in opposition rests mostly,I am sorry to say, on these socialistic Italians, sir, with theirsecret societies, camorras, and such-like. There are lots ofItalians settled here on the railway lands, dismissed navvies,mechanics, and so on, all along the trunk line.  There are wholevillages of Italians on the Campo.  And the natives, too, arebeing drawn into these ways . . . American bar? Yes. And overthere you can see another. New Yorkers mostly frequent thatone----Here we are at the Amarilla. Observe the bishop at thefoot of the stairs to the right as we go in."And the lunch would begin and terminate its lavish and leisurelycourse at a little table in the gallery, Captain Mitchellnodding, bowing, getting up to speak for a moment to differentofficials in black clothes, merchants in jackets, officers inuniform, middle-aged caballeros from the Campo--sallow, little,nervous men, and fat, placid, swarthy men, and Europeans or NorthAmericans of superior standing, whose faces looked very whiteamongst the majority of dark complexions and black, glisteningeyes.Captain Mitchell would lie back in the chair, casting aroundlooks of satisfaction, and tender over the table a case full ofthick cigars."Try a weed with your coffee. Local tobacco. The black coffee youget at the Amarilla, sir, you don't meet anywhere in the world.We get the bean from a famous cafeteria in the foot-hills, whoseowner sends three sacks every year as a present to his fellowmembers in remembrance of the fight against Gamacho's Nationals,carried on from these very windows by the caballeros. He was intown at the time, and took part, sir, to the bitter end.  Itarrives on three mules--not in the common way, by rail; nofear!--right into the patio, escorted by mounted peons, in chargeof the Mayoral of his estate, who walks upstairs, booted andspurred, and delivers it to our committee formally with thewords, 'For the sake of those fallen on the third of May.' Wecall it Tres de Mayo coffee. Taste it."Captain Mitchell, with an expression as though making ready tohear a sermon in a church, would lift the tiny cup to his lips.And the nectar would be sipped to the bottom during a restfulsilence in a cloud of cigar smoke."Look at this man in black just going out," he would begin,leaning forward hastily. "This is the famous Hernandez, Ministerof War. The Times' special correspondent, who wrote that strikingseries of letters calling the Occidental Republic the 'TreasureHouse of the World,' gave a whole article to him and the force hehas organized--the renowned Carabineers of the Campo."Captain Mitchell's guest, staring curiously, would see a figurein a long-tailed black coat walking gravely, with downcasteyelids in a long, composed face, a brow furrowed horizontally, apointed head, whose grey hair, thin at the top, combed downcarefully on all sides and rolled at the ends, fell low on theneck and shoulders. This, then, was the famous bandit of whomEurope had heard with interest. He put on a high-crowned sombrerowith a wide flat brim; a rosary of wooden beads was twisted abouthis right wrist.  And Captain Mitchell would proceed--"The protector of the Sulaco refugees from the rage of Pedrito.As general of cavalry with Barrios he distinguished himself atthe storming of Tonoro, where Senor Fuentes was killed with thelast remnant of the Monterists.  He is the friend and humbleservant of Bishop Corbelan. Hears three Masses every day. I betyou he will step into the cathedral to say a prayer or two on hisway home to his siesta."He took several puffs at his cigar in silence; then, in his mostimportant manner, pronounced:"The Spanish race, sir, is prolific of remarkable characters inevery rank of life. . . . I propose we go now into thebilliard-room, which is cool, for a quiet chat. There's neveranybody there till after five. I could tell you episodes of theSeparationist revolution that would astonish you. When the greatheat's over, we'll take a turn on the Alameda."The programme went on relentless, like a law of Nature. The turnon the Alameda was taken with slow steps and stately remarks."All the great world of Sulaco here, sir." Captain Mitchell bowedright and left with no end of formality; then with animation,"Dona Emilia, Mrs. Gould's carriage. Look. Always white mules.The kindest, most gracious woman the sun ever shone upon. A greatposition, sir. A great position. First lady in Sulaco--far beforethe President's wife. And worthy of it." He took off his hat;then, with a studied change of tone, added, negligently, that theman in black by her side, with a high white collar and a scarred,snarly face, was Dr. Monygham, Inspector of State Hospitals,chief medical officer of the Consolidated San Tome mines. "Afamiliar of the house. Everlastingly there. No wonder. The Gouldsmade him.  Very clever man and all that, but I never liked him.Nobody does. I can recollect him limping about the streets in acheck shirt and native sandals with a watermelon under hisarm--all he would get to eat for the day. A big-wig now, sir, andas nasty as ever. However . . . There's no doubt he played hispart fairly well at the time. He saved us all from the deadlyincubus of Sotillo, where a more particular man might havefailed----"His arm went up."The equestrian statue that used to stand on the pedestal overthere has been removed. It was an anachronism," Captain Mitchellcommented, obscurely.  "There is some talk of replacing it by amarble shaft commemorative of Separation, with angels of peace atthe four corners, and bronze Justice holding an even balance, allgilt, on the top. Cavaliere Parrochetti was asked to make adesign, which you can see framed under glass in the MunicipalSala. Names are to be engraved all round the base. Well! Theycould do no better than begin with the name of Nostromo. He hasdone for Separation as much as anybody else, and," added CaptainMitchell, "has got less than many others by it--when it comes tothat." He dropped on to a stone seat under a tree, and tappedinvitingly at the place by his side. "He carried to Barrios theletters from Sulaco which decided the General to abandon Caytafor a time, and come back to our help here by sea.  Thetransports were still in harbour fortunately. Sir, I did not evenknow that my Capataz de Cargadores was alive. I had no idea. Itwas Dr. Monygham who came upon him, by chance, in the CustomHouse, evacuated an hour or two before by the wretched Sotillo.I was never told; never given a hint, nothing--as if I wereunworthy of confidence. Monygham arranged it all. He went to therailway yards, and got admission to the engineer-in-chief, who,for the sake of the Goulds as much as for anything else,consented to let an engine make a dash down the line, one hundredand eighty miles, with Nostromo aboard. It was the only way toget him off. In the Construction Camp at the railhead, heobtained a horse, arms, some clothing, and started alone on thatmarvellous ride--four hundred miles in six days, through adisturbed country, ending by the feat of passing through theMonterist lines outside Cayta. The history of that ride, sir,would make a most exciting book. He carried all our lives in hispocket. Devotion, courage, fidelity, intelligence were notenough. Of course, he was perfectly fearless and incorruptible.But a man was wanted that would know how to succeed. He was thatman, sir. On the fifth of May, being practically a prisoner inthe Harbour Office of my Company, I suddenly heard the whistle ofan engine in the railway yards, a quarter of a mile away. I couldnot believe my ears. I made one jump on to the balcony, andbeheld a locomotive under a great head of steam run out of theyard gates, screeching like mad, enveloped in a white cloud, andthen, just abreast of old Viola's inn, check almost to astandstill.  I made out, sir, a man--I couldn't tell who--dashout of the Albergo d'ltalia Una, climb into the cab, and then,sir, that engine seemed positively to leap clear of the house,and was gone in the twinkling of an eye.  As you blow a candleout, sir! There was a first-rate driver on the foot-plate, sir, Ican tell you. They were fired heavily upon by the National Guardsin Rincon and one other place. Fortunately the line had not beentorn up. In four hours they reached the Construction Camp.Nostromo had his start. . . . The rest you know. You've got onlyto look round you.  There are people on this Alameda that ride intheir carriages, or even are alive at all to-day, because yearsago I engaged a runaway Italian sailor for a foreman of our wharfsimply on the strength of his looks. And that's a fact. You can'tget over it, sir. On the seventeenth of May, just twelve daysafter I saw the man from the Casa Viola get on the engine, andwondered what it meant, Barrios's transports were entering thisharbour, and the 'Treasure House of the World,' as The Times mancalls Sulaco in his book, was saved intact for civilization--fora great future, sir. Pedrito, with Hernandez on the west, and theSan Tome miners pressing on the land gate, was not able to opposethe landing. He had been sending messages to Sotillo for a weekto join him. Had Sotillo done so there would have been massacresand proscription that would have left no man or woman of positionalive. But that's where Dr. Monygham comes in. Sotillo, blind anddeaf to everything, stuck on board his steamer watching thedragging for silver, which he believed to be sunk at the bottomof the harbour. They say that for the last three days he was outof his mind raving and foaming with disappointment at gettingnothing, flying about the deck, and yelling curses at the boatswith the drags, ordering them in, and then suddenly stamping hisfoot and crying out, 'And yet it is there!  I see it! I feel it!'"He was preparing to hang Dr. Monygham (whom he had on board) atthe end of the after-derrick, when the first of Barrios'stransports, one of our own ships at that, steamed right in, andranging close alongside opened a small-arm fire without as muchpreliminaries as a hail. It was the completest surprise in theworld, sir. They were too astounded at first to bolt below.  Menwere falling right and left like ninepins. It's a miracle thatMonygham, standing on the after-hatch with the rope already roundhis neck, escaped being riddled through and through like a sieve.He told me since that he had given himself up for lost, and kepton yelling with all the strength of his lungs: 'Hoist a whiteflag! Hoist a white flag!' Suddenly an old major of the Esmeraldaregiment, standing by, unsheathed his sword with a shriek: 'Die,perjured traitor!' and ran Sotillo clean through the body, justbefore he fell himself shot through the head."Captain Mitchell stopped for a while."Begad, sir! I could spin you a yarn for hours.  But it's time westarted off to Rincon. It would not do for you to pass throughSulaco and not see the lights of the San Tome mine, a wholemountain ablaze like a lighted palace above the dark Campo. It'sa fashionable drive. . . . But let me tell you one littleanecdote, sir; just to show you. A fortnight or more later, whenBarrios, declared Generalissimo, was gone in pursuit of Pedritoaway south, when the Provisional Junta, with Don Juste Lopez atits head, had promulgated the new Constitution, and our DonCarlos Gould was packing up his trunks bound on a mission to SanFrancisco and Washington (the United States, sir, were the firstgreat power to recognize the Occidental Republic)--a fortnightlater, I say, when we were beginning to feel that our heads weresafe on our shoulders, if I may express myself so, a prominentman, a large shipper by our line, came to see me on business,and, says he, the first thing: 'I say, Captain Mitchell, is thatfellow' (meaning Nostromo) 'still the Capataz of your Cargadoresor not?' 'What's the matter?' says I.  'Because, if he is, then Idon't mind; I send and receive a good lot of cargo by your ships;but I have observed him several days loafing about the wharf, andjust now he stopped me as cool as you please, with a request fora cigar. Now, you know, my cigars are rather special, and I can'tget them so easily as all that.' 'I hope you stretched a point,'I said, very gently. 'Why, yes.  But it's a confounded nuisance.The fellow's everlastingly cadging for smokes.' Sir, I turned myeyes away, and then asked, 'Weren't you one of the prisoners inthe Cabildo?' 'You know very well I was, and in chains, too,'says he. 'And under a fine of fifteen thousand dollars?' Hecoloured, sir, because it got about that he fainted from frightwhen they came to arrest him, and then behaved before Fuentes ina manner to make the very policianos, who had dragged him thereby the hair of his head, smile at his cringing.  'Yes,' he says,in a sort of shy way. 'Why?' 'Oh, nothing. You stood to lose atidy bit,' says I, 'even if you saved your life. . . . But whatcan I do for you?' He never even saw the point. Not he.  Andthat's how the world wags, sir."He rose a little stiffly, and the drive to Rincon would be takenwith only one philosophical remark, uttered by the mercilesscicerone, with his eyes fixed upon the lights of San Tome, thatseemed suspended in the dark night between earth and heaven."A great power, this, for good and evil, sir. A great power."And the dinner of the Mirliflores would be eaten, excellent as tocooking, and leaving upon the traveller's mind an impression thatthere were in Sulaco many pleasant, able young men with salariesapparently too large for their discretion, and amongst them afew, mostly Anglo-Saxon, skilled in the art of, as the saying is,"taking a rise" out of his kind host.With a rapid, jingling drive to the harbour in a twowheeledmachine (which Captain Mitchell called a curricle) behind a fleetand scraggy mule beaten all the time by an obviously Neapolitandriver, the cycle would be nearly closed before the lighted-upoffices of the O. S. N. Company, remaining open so late becauseof the steamer. Nearly--but not quite."Ten o'clock. Your ship won't be ready to leave till half-pasttwelve, if by then. Come in for a brandy-and-soda and one morecigar."And in the superintendent's private room the privileged passengerby the Ceres, or Juno, or Pallas, stunned and as it wereannihilated mentally by a sudden surfeit of sights, sounds,names, facts, and complicated information imperfectlyapprehended, would listen like a tired child to a fairy tale;would hear a voice, familiar and surprising in its pompousness,tell him, as if from another world, how there was "in this veryharbour" an international naval demonstration, which put an endto the Costaguana-Sulaco War. How the United States cruiser,Powhattan, was the first to salute the Occidental flag--white,with a wreath of green laurel in the middle encircling a yellowamarilla flower. Would hear how General Montero, in less than amonth after proclaiming himself Emperor of Costaguana, was shotdead (during a solemn and public distribution of orders andcrosses) by a young artillery officer, the brother of his thenmistress."The abominable Pedrito, sir, fled the country," the voice wouldsay. And it would continue: "A captain of one of our ships toldme lately that he recognized Pedrito the Guerrillero, arrayed inpurple slippers and a velvet smoking-cap with a gold tassel,keeping a disorderly house in one of the southern ports.""Abominable Pedrito! Who the devil was he?" would wonder thedistinguished bird of passage hovering on the confines of wakingand sleep with resolutely open eyes and a faint but amiable curlupon his lips, from between which stuck out the eighteenth ortwentieth cigar of that memorable day."He appeared to me in this very room like a haunting ghost,sir"--Captain Mitchell was talking of his Nostromo with truewarmth of feeling and a touch of wistful pride. "You may imagine,sir, what an effect it produced on me. He had come round by seawith Barrios, of course. And the first thing he told me after Ibecame fit to hear him was that he had picked up the lighter'sboat floating in the gulf! He seemed quite overcome by thecircumstance. And a remarkable enough circumstance it was, whenyou remember that it was then sixteen days since the sinking ofthe silver.  At once I could see he was another man. He stared atthe wall, sir, as if there had been a spider or something runningabout there. The loss of the silver preyed on his mind. The firstthing he asked me about was whether Dona Antonia had heard yet ofDecoud's death. His voice trembled. I had to tell him that DonaAntonia, as a matter of fact, was not back in town yet. Poorgirl! And just as I was making ready to ask him a thousandquestions, with a sudden, 'Pardon me, senor,' he cleared out ofthe office altogether.  I did not see him again for three days. Iwas terribly busy, you know. It seems that he wandered about inand out of the town, and on two nights turned up to sleep in thebaracoons of the railway people.  He seemed absolutelyindifferent to what went on. I asked him on the wharf, 'When areyou going to take hold again, Nostromo? There will be plenty ofwork for the Cargadores presently.'"'Senor,' says he, looking at me in a slow, inquisitive manner,'would it surprise you to hear that I am too tired to work justyet? And what work could I do now?  How can I look my Cargadoresin the face after losing a lighter?'"I begged him not to think any more about the silver, and hesmiled. A smile that went to my heart, sir. 'It was no mistake,'I told him. 'It was a fatality. A thing that could not behelped.' 'Si, si!" he said, and turned away. I thought it best toleave him alone for a bit to get over it. Sir, it took him yearsreally, to get over it. I was present at his interview with DonCarlos.  I must say that Gould is rather a cold man. He had tokeep a tight hand on his feelings, dealing with thieves andrascals, in constant danger of ruin for himself and wife for somany years, that it had become a second nature. They looked ateach other for a long time. Don Carlos asked what he could do forhim, in his quiet, reserved way."'My name is known from one end of Sulaco to the other,' he said,as quiet as the other. 'What more can you do for me?' That wasall that passed on that occasion.  Later, however, there was avery fine coasting schooner for sale, and Mrs. Gould and I putour heads together to get her bought and presented to him.  Itwas done, but he paid all the price back within the next threeyears. Business was booming all along this seaboard, sir.Moreover, that man always succeeded in everything except insaving the silver. Poor Dona Antonia, fresh from her terribleexperiences in the woods of Los Hatos, had an interview with him,too.  Wanted to hear about Decoud: what they said, what they did,what they thought up to the last on that fatal night. Mrs. Gouldtold me his manner was perfect for quietness and sympathy. MissAvellanos burst into tears only when he told her how Decoud hadhappened to say that his plan would be a glorious success.  . . .And there's no doubt, sir, that it is.  It is a success."The cycle was about to close at last. And while the privilegedpassenger, shivering with the pleasant anticipations of hisberth, forgot to ask himself, "What on earth Decoud's plan couldbe?" Captain Mitchell was saying, "Sorry we must part so soon.Your intelligent interest made this a pleasant day to me. I shallsee you now on board. You had a glimpse of the 'Treasure House ofthe World.' A very good name that." And the coxswain's voice atthe door, announcing that the gig was ready, closed the cycle.Nostromo had, indeed, found the lighter's boat, which he had lefton the Great Isabel with Decoud, floating empty far out in thegulf. He was then on the bridge of the first of Barrios'stransports, and within an hour's steaming from Sulaco. Barrios,always delighted with a feat of daring and a good judge ofcourage, had taken a great liking to the Capataz. During thepassage round the coast the General kept Nostromo near hisperson, addressing him frequently in that abrupt and boisterousmanner which was the sign of his high favour.Nostromo's eyes were the first to catch, broad on the bow, thetiny, elusive dark speck, which, alone with the forms of theThree Isabels right ahead, appeared on the flat, shimmeringemptiness of the gulf. There are times when no fact should beneglected as insignificant; a small boat so far from the landmight have had some meaning worth finding out. At a nod ofconsent from Barrios the transport swept out of her course,passing near enough to ascertain that no one manned the littlecockle-shell. It was merely a common small boat gone adrift withher oars in her. But Nostromo, to whose mind Decoud had beeninsistently present for days, had long before recognized withexcitement the dinghy of the lighter.There could be no question of stopping to pick up that thing.Every minute of time was momentous with the lives and futures ofa whole town. The head of the leading ship, with the General onboard, fell off to her course. Behind her, the fleet oftransports, scattered haphazard over a mile or so in the offing,like the finish of an ocean race, pressed on, all black andsmoking on the western sky."Mi General," Nostromo's voice rang out loud, but quiet, frombehind a group of officers, "I should like to save that littleboat. Por Dios, I know her. She belongs to my Company.""And, por Dios," guffawed Barrios, in a noisy, goodhumouredvoice, "you belong to me. I am going to make you a captain ofcavalry directly we get within sight of a horse again.""I can swim far better than I can ride, mi General," criedNostromo, pushing through to the rail with a set              stare in his eyes. "Let me----"                                  "Let you? What a conceited fellow that is," bantered the General,jovially, without even looking at him.  "Let him go! Ha! ha! ha!He wants me to admit that we cannot take Sulaco without him! Ha!ha!  ha! Would you like to swim off to her, my son?"A tremendous shout from one end of the ship to the other stoppedhis guffaw. Nostromo had leaped overboard; and his black headbobbed up far away already from the ship. The General muttered anappalled "Cielo! Sinner that I am!" in a thunderstruck tone.  Oneanxious glance was enough to show him that Nostromo was swimmingwith perfect ease; and then he thundered terribly, "No! no! Weshall not stop to pick up this impertinent fellow. Let himdrown--that mad Capataz."Nothing short of main force would have kept Nostromo from leapingoverboard. That empty boat, coming out to meet him mysteriously,as if rowed by an invisible spectre, exercised the fascination ofsome sign, of some warning, seemed to answer in a startling andenigmatic way the persistent thought of a treasure and of a man'sfate. He would have leaped if there had been death in thathalf-mile of water. It was as smooth as a pond, and for somereason sharks are unknown in the Placid Gulf, though on the otherside of the Punta Mala the coastline swarms with them.The Capataz seized hold of the stern and blew with force. Aqueer, faint feeling had come over him while he swam. He had gotrid of his boots and coat in the water. He hung on for a time,regaining his breath. In the distance the transports, more in abunch now, held on straight for Sulaco, with their air offriendly contest, of nautical sport, of a regatta; and the unitedsmoke of their funnels drove like a thin, sulphurous fogbankright over his head. It was his daring, his courage, his act thathad set these ships in motion upon the sea, hurrying on to savethe lives and fortunes of the Blancos, the taskmasters of thepeople; to save the San Tome mine; to save the children.With a vigorous and skilful effort he clambered over the stern.The very boat! No doubt of it; no doubt whatever. It was thedinghy of the lighter No. 3--the dinghy left with Martin Decoudon the Great Isabel so that he should have some means to helphimself if nothing could be done for him from the shore. And hereshe had come out to meet him empty and inexplicable.  What hadbecome of Decoud? The Capataz made a minute examination. Helooked for some scratch, for some mark, for some sign. All hediscovered was a brown stain on the gunwale abreast of thethwart. He bent his face over it and rubbed hard with his finger.Then he sat down in the stern sheets, passive, with his kneesclose together and legs aslant.Streaming from head to foot, with his hair and whiskers hanginglank and dripping and a lustreless stare fixed upon the bottomboards, the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores resembled a drownedcorpse come up from the bottom to idle away the sunset hour in asmall boat. The excitement of his adventurous ride, theexcitement of the return in time, of achievement, of success, allthis excitement centred round the associated ideas of the greattreasure and of the only other man who knew of its existence, haddeparted from him.  To the very last moment he had beencudgelling his brains as to how he could manage to visit theGreat Isabel without loss of time and undetected. For the idea ofsecrecy had come to be connected with the treasure so closelythat even to Barrios himself he had refrained from mentioning theexistence of Decoud and of the silver on the island. The lettershe carried to the General, however, made brief mention of theloss of the lighter, as having its bearing upon the situation inSulaco. In the circumstances, the one-eyed tiger-slayer, scentingbattle from afar, had not wasted his time in making inquiriesfrom the messenger.  In fact, Barrios, talking with Nostromo,assumed that both Don Martin Decoud and the ingots of San Tomewere lost together, and Nostromo, not questioned directly, hadkept silent, under the influence of some indefinable form ofresentment and distrust. Let Don Martin speak of everything withhis own lips--was what he told himself mentally.And now, with the means of gaining the Great Isabel thrown thusin his way at the earliest possible moment, his excitement haddeparted, as when the soul takes flight leaving the body inertupon an earth it knows no more. Nostromo did not seem to know thegulf.  For a long time even his eyelids did not flutter once uponthe glazed emptiness of his stare. Then slowly, without a limbhaving stirred, without a twitch of muscle or quiver of aneyelash, an expression, a living expression came upon the stillfeatures, deep thought crept into the empty stare--as if anoutcast soul, a quiet, brooding soul, finding that untenantedbody in its way, had come in stealthily to take possession.The Capataz frowned: and in the immense stillness of sea,islands, and coast, of cloud forms on the sky and trails of lightupon the water, the knitting of that brow had the emphasis of apowerful gesture. Nothing else budged for a long time; then theCapataz shook his head and again surrendered himself to theuniversal repose of all visible things. Suddenly he seized theoars, and with one movement made the dinghy spin round, head-onto the Great Isabel. But before he began to pull he bent oncemore over the brown stain on the gunwale."I know that thing," he muttered to himself, with a sagaciousjerk of the head. "That's blood."His stroke was long, vigorous, and steady. Now and then he lookedover his shoulder at the Great Isabel, presenting its low cliffto his anxious gaze like an impenetrable face. At last the stemtouched the strand.  He flung rather than dragged the boat up thelittle beach. At once, turning his back upon the sunset, heplunged with long strides into the ravine, making the water ofthe stream spurt and fly upwards at every step, as if spurningits shallow, clear, murmuring spirit with his feet. He wanted tosave every moment of daylight.A mass of earth, grass, and smashed bushes had fallen down verynaturally from above upon the cavity under the leaning tree.Decoud had attended to the concealment of the silver asinstructed, using the spade with some intelligence. ButNostromo's half-smile of approval changed into a scornful curl ofthe lip by the sight of the spade itself flung there in fullview, as if in utter carelessness or sudden panic, giving awaythe whole thing. Ah! They were all alike in their folly, thesehombres finos that invented laws and governments and barren tasksfor the people.The Capataz picked up the spade, and with the feel of the handlein his palm the desire of having a look at the horse-hide boxesof treasure came upon him suddenly.  In a very few strokes heuncovered the edges and corners of several; then, clearing awaymore earth, became aware that one of them had been slashed with aknife.He exclaimed at that discovery in a stifled voice, and dropped onhis knees with a look of irrational apprehension over oneshoulder, then over the other. The stiff hide had closed, and hehesitated before he pushed his hand through the long slit andfelt the ingots inside.  There they were. One, two, three. Yes,four gone.  Taken away. Four ingots. But who? Decoud? Nobodyelse. And why? For what purpose? For what cursed fancy? Let himexplain. Four ingots carried off in a boat, and--blood!In the face of the open gulf, the sun, clear, unclouded,unaltered, plunged into the waters in a grave and untroubledmystery of self-immolation consummated far from all mortal eyes,with an infinite majesty of silence and peace. Four ingotsshort!--and blood!The Capataz got up slowly."He might simply have cut his hand," he muttered.  "But,then----"He sat down on the soft earth, unresisting, as if he had beenchained to the treasure, his drawn-up legs clasped in his handswith an air of hopeless submission, like a slave set on guard.Once only he lifted his head smartly: the rattle of hot musketryfire had reached his ears, like pouring from on high a stream ofdry peas upon a drum. After listening for a while, he said, halfaloud--"He will never come back to explain."And he lowered his head again."Impossible!" he muttered, gloomily.The sounds of firing died out. The loom of a great conflagrationin Sulaco flashed up red above the coast, played on the clouds atthe head of the gulf, seemed to touch with a ruddy and sinisterreflection the forms of the Three Isabels. He never saw it,though he raised his head."But, then, I cannot know," he pronounced, distinctly, andremained silent and staring for hours.He could not know. Nobody was to know. As might have beensupposed, the end of Don Martin Decoud never became a subject ofspeculation for any one except Nostromo. Had the truth of thefacts been known, there would always have remained the question.Why? Whereas the version of his death at the sinking of thelighter had no uncertainty of motive. The young apostle ofSeparation had died striving for his idea by an ever-lamentedaccident.  But the truth was that he died from solitude, theenemy known but to few on this earth, and whom only the simplestof us are fit to withstand. The brilliant Costaguanero of theboulevards had died from solitude and want of faith in himselfand others.For some good and valid reasons beyond mere human comprehension,the sea-birds of the gulf shun the Isabels.  The rocky head ofAzuera is their haunt, whose stony levels and chasms resound withtheir wild and tumultuous clamour as if they were for everquarrelling over the legendary treasure.At the end of his first day on the Great Isabel, Decoud, turningin his lair of coarse grass, under the shade of a tree, said tohimself--"I have not seen as much as one single bird all day."And he had not heard a sound, either, all day but that one now ofhis own muttering voice. It had been a day of absolutesilence--the first he had known in his life. And he had not slepta wink. Not for all these wakeful nights and the days offighting, planning, talking; not for all that last night ofdanger and hard physical toil upon the gulf, had he been able toclose his eyes for a moment. And yet from sunrise to sunset hehad been lying prone on the ground, either on his back or on hisface.He stretched himself, and with slow steps descended into thegully to spend the night by the side of the silver.  If Nostromoreturned--as he might have done at any moment--it was there thathe would look first; and night would, of course, be the propertime for an attempt to communicate. He remembered with profoundindifference that he had not eaten anything yet since he had beenleft alone on the island.He spent the night open-eyed, and when the day broke he atesomething with the same indifference.  The brilliant "SonDecoud," the spoiled darling of the family, the lover of Antoniaand journalist of Sulaco, was not fit to grapple with himselfsingle-handed.  Solitude from mere outward condition of existencebecomes very swiftly a state of soul in which the affectations ofirony and scepticism have no place. It takes possession of themind, and drives forth the thought into the exile of utterunbelief. After three days of waiting for the sight of some humanface, Decoud caught himself entertaining a doubt of his ownindividuality.  It had merged into the world of cloud and water,of natural forces and forms of nature. In our activity alone dowe find the sustaining illusion of an independent existence asagainst the whole scheme of things of which we form a helplesspart.  Decoud lost all belief in the reality of his action pastand to come. On the fifth day an immense melancholy descendedupon him palpably. He resolved not to give himself up to thesepeople in Sulaco, who had beset him, unreal and terrible, likejibbering and obscene spectres. He saw himself struggling feeblyin their midst, and Antonia, gigantic and lovely like anallegorical statue, looking on with scornful eyes at hisweakness.Not a living being, not a speck of distant sail, appeared withinthe range of his vision; and, as if to escape from this solitude,he absorbed himself in his melancholy. The vague consciousness ofa misdirected life given up to impulses whose memory left abitter taste in his mouth was the first moral sentiment of hismanhood. But at the same time he felt no remorse.  What should heregret? He had recognized no other virtue than intelligence, andhad erected passions into duties. Both his intelligence and hispassion were swallowed up easily in this great unbroken solitudeof waiting without faith. Sleeplessness had robbed his will ofall energy, for he had not slept seven hours in the seven days.His sadness was the sadness of a sceptical mind. He beheld theuniverse as a succession of incomprehensible images. Nostromo wasdead. Everything had failed ignominiously. He no longer dared tothink of Antonia. She had not survived. But if she survived hecould not face her. And all exertion seemed senseless.On the tenth day, after a night spent without even dozing offonce (it had occurred to him that Antonia could not possibly haveever loved a being so impalpable as himself), the solitudeappeared like a great void, and the silence of the gulf like atense, thin cord to which he hung suspended by both hands,without fear, without surprise, without any sort of emotionwhatever. Only towards the evening, in the comparative relief ofcoolness, he began to wish that this cord would snap. He imaginedit snapping with a report as of a pistol--a sharp, full crack.And that would be the end of him. He contemplated thateventuality with pleasure, because he dreaded the sleeplessnights in which the silence, remaining unbroken in the shape of acord to which he hung with both hands, vibrated with senselessphrases, always the same but utterly incomprehensible, aboutNostromo, Antonia, Barrios, and proclamations mingled into anironical and senseless buzzing. In the daytime he could look atthe silence like a still cord stretched to breakingpoint, withhis life, his vain life, suspended to it like a weight."I wonder whether I would hear it snap before I fell," he askedhimself.The sun was two hours above the horizon when he got up, gaunt,dirty, white-faced, and looked at it with his red-rimmed eyes.His limbs obeyed him slowly, as if full of lead, yet withouttremor; and the effect of that physical condition gave to hismovements an unhesitating, deliberate dignity. He acted as ifaccomplishing some sort of rite. He descended into the gully; forthe fascination of all that silver, with its potential power,survived alone outside of himself. He picked up the belt with therevolver, that was lying there, and buckled it round his waist.The cord of silence could never snap on the island. It must lethim fall and sink into the sea, he thought. And sink! He waslooking at the loose earth covering the treasure. In the sea!His aspect was that of a somnambulist. He lowered himself down onhis knees slowly and went on grubbing with his fingers withindustrious patience till he uncovered one of the boxes. Withouta pause, as if doing some work done many times before, he slit itopen and took four ingots, which he put in his pockets. Hecovered up the exposed box again and step by step came out of thegully. The bushes closed after him with a swish.It was on the third day of his solitude that he had dragged thedinghy near the water with an idea of rowing away somewhere, buthad desisted partly at the whisper of lingering hope thatNostromo would return, partly from conviction of utteruselessness of all effort.  Now she wanted only a slight shove tobe set afloat.  He had eaten a little every day after the first,and had some muscular strength left yet. Taking up the oarsslowly, he pulled away from the cliff of the Great Isabel, thatstood behind him warm with sunshine, as if with the heat of life,bathed in a rich light from head to foot as if in a radiance ofhope and joy. He pulled straight towards the setting sun. Whenthe gulf had grown dark, he ceased rowing and flung the scullsin. The hollow clatter they made in falling was the loudest noisehe had ever heard in his life. It was a revelation. It seemed torecall him from far away, Actually the thought, "Perhaps I maysleep to-night," passed through his mind. But he did not believeit.  He believed in nothing; and he remained sitting on thethwart.The dawn from behind the mountains put a gleam into his unwinkingeyes. After a clear daybreak the sun appeared splendidly abovethe peaks of the range.  The great gulf burst into a glitter allaround the boat; and in this glory of merciless solitude thesilence appeared again before him, stretched taut like a dark,thin string.His eyes looked at it while, without haste, he shifted his seatfrom the thwart to the gunwale. They looked at it fixedly, whilehis hand, feeling about his waist, unbuttoned the flap of theleather case, drew the revolver, cocked it, brought it forwardpointing at his breast, pulled the trigger, and, with convulsiveforce, sent the still-smoking weapon hurtling through the air.His eyes looked at it while he fell forward and hung with hisbreast on the gunwale and the fingers of his right hand hookedunder the thwart. They looked----"It is done," he stammered out, in a sudden flow of blood. Hislast thought was: "I wonder how that Capataz died." The stiffnessof the fingers relaxed, and the lover of Antonia Avellanos rolledoverboard without having heard the cord of silence snap in thesolitude of the Placid Gulf, whose glittering surface remaineduntroubled by the fall of his body.A victim of the disillusioned weariness which is the retributionmeted out to intellectual audacity, the brilliant Don MartinDecoud, weighted by the bars of San Tome silver, disappearedwithout a trace, swallowed up in the immense indifference ofthings. His sleepless, crouching figure was gone from the side ofthe San Tome silver; and for a time the spirits of good and evilthat hover near every concealed treasure of the earth might havethought that this one had been forgotten by all mankind. Then,after a few days, another form appeared striding away from thesetting sun to sit motionless and awake in the narrow black gullyall through the night, in nearly the same pose, in the same placein which had sat that other sleepless man who had gone away forever so quietly in a small boat, about the time of sunset. Andthe spirits of good and evil that hover about a forbiddentreasure understood well that the silver of San Tome was providednow with a faithful and lifelong slave.The magnificent Capataz de Cargadores, victim of the disenchantedvanity which is the reward of audacious action, sat in the wearypose of a hunted outcast through a night of sleeplessness astormenting as any known to Decoud, his companion in the mostdesperate affair of his life. And he wondered how Decoud haddied. But he knew the part he had played himself.  First a woman,then a man, abandoned both in their last extremity, for the sakeof this accursed treasure.  It was paid for by a soul lost and bya vanished life.  The blank stillness of awe was succeeded by agust of immense pride. There was no one in the world but Gian'Battista Fidanza, Capataz de Cargadores, the incorruptible andfaithful Nostromo, to pay such a price.He had made up his mind that nothing should be allowed now to robhim of his bargain. Nothing. Decoud had died. But how? That hewas dead he had not a shadow of a doubt. But four ingots? . . .What for? Did he mean to come for more--some other time?The treasure was putting forth its latent power.  It troubled theclear mind of the man who had paid the price. He was sure thatDecoud was dead. The island seemed full of that whisper. Dead!Gone!  And he caught himself listening for the swish of bushesand the splash of the footfalls in the bed of the brook.  Dead!The talker, the novio of Dona Antonia!"Ha!" he murmured, with his head on his knees, under the lividclouded dawn breaking over the liberated Sulaco and upon the gulfas gray as ashes. "It is to her that he will fly. To her that hewill fly!"And four ingots! Did he take them in revenge, to cast a spell,like the angry woman who had prophesied remorse and failure, andyet had laid upon him the task of saving the children? Well, hehad saved the children. He had defeated the spell of poverty andstarvation. He had done it all alone--or perhaps helped by thedevil. Who cared? He had done it, betrayed as he was, and savingby the same stroke the San Tome mine, which appeared to himhateful and immense, lording it by its vast wealth over thevalour, the toil, the fidelity of the poor, over war and peace,over the labours of the town, the sea, and the Campo.The sun lit up the sky behind the peaks of the Cordillera.  TheCapataz looked down for a time upon the fall of loose earth,stones, and smashed bushes, concealing the hiding-place of thesilver."I must grow rich very slowly," he meditated, aloud.CHAPTER ELEVENSULACO outstripped Nostromo's prudence, growing rich swiftly onthe hidden treasures of the earth, hovered over by the anxiousspirits of good and evil, torn out by the labouring hands of thepeople. It was like a second youth, like a new life, full ofpromise, of unrest, of toil, scattering lavishly its wealth tothe four corners of an excited world. Material changes sweptalong in the train of material interests. And other changes moresubtle, outwardly unmarked, affected the minds and hearts of theworkers. Captain Mitchell had gone home to live on his savingsinvested in the San Tome mine; and Dr. Monygham had grown older,with his head steel-grey and the unchanged expression of hisface, living on the inexhaustible treasure of his devotion drawnupon in the secret of his heart like a store of unlawful wealth.The Inspector-General of State Hospitals (whose maintenance is acharge upon the Gould Concession), Official Adviser on Sanitationto the Municipality, Chief Medical Officer of the San TomeConsolidated Mines (whose territory, containing gold, silver,copper, lead, cobalt, extends for miles along the foot-hills ofthe Cordillera), had felt poverty-stricken, miserable, andstarved during the prolonged, second visit the Goulds paid toEurope and the United States of America.  Intimate of the casa,proved friend, a bachelor without ties and without establishment(except of the professional sort), he had been asked to take uphis quarters in the Gould house. In the eleven months oftheir absence the familiar rooms, recalling at every glance thewoman to whom he had given all his loyalty, had grownintolerable. As the day approached for the arrival of the mailboat Hermes (the latest addition to the O. S. N. Co.'s splendidfleet), the doctor hobbled about more vivaciously, snapped moresardonically at simple and gentle out of sheer nervousness.He packed up his modest trunk with speed, with fury, withenthusiasm, and saw it carried out past the old porter at thegate of the Casa Gould with delight, with intoxication; then, asthe hour approached, sitting alone in the great landau behind thewhite mules, a little sideways, his drawn-in face positivelyvenomous with the effort of self-control, and holding a pair ofnew gloves in his left hand, he drove to the harbour.His heart dilated within him so, when he saw the Goulds on thedeck of the Hermes, that his greetings were reduced to a casualmutter. Driving back to town, all three were silent. And in thepatio the doctor, in a more natural manner, said--"I'll leave you now to yourselves. I'll call to-morrow if I may?""Come to lunch, dear Dr. Monygham, and come early," said Mrs.Gould, in her travelling dress and her veil down, turning to lookat him at the foot of the stairs; while at the top of the flightthe Madonna, in blue robes and the Child on her arm, seemed towelcome her with an aspect of pitying tenderness."Don't expect to find me at home," Charles Gould warned him."I'll be off early to the mine."After lunch, Dona Emilia and the senor doctor came slowly throughthe inner gateway of the patio. The large gardens of the CasaGould, surrounded by high walls, and the red-tile slopes ofneighbouring roofs, lay open before them, with masses of shadeunder the trees and level surfaces of sunlight upon the lawns. Atriple row of old orange trees surrounded the whole. Barefooted,brown gardeners, in snowy white shirts and wide calzoneras,dotted the grounds, squatting over flowerbeds, passing betweenthe trees, dragging slender India-rubber tubes across the gravelof the paths; and the fine jets of water crossed each other ingraceful curves, sparkling in the sunshine with a slightpattering noise upon the bushes, and an effect of showereddiamonds upon the grass.Dona Emilia, holding up the train of a clear dress, walked by theside of Dr. Monygham, in a longish black coat and severe blackbow on an immaculate shirtfront.  Under a shady clump of trees,where stood scattered little tables and wicker easy-chairs, Mrs.Gould sat down in a low and ample seat."Don't go yet," she said to Dr. Monygham, who was unable to tearhimself away from the spot. His chin nestling within the pointsof his collar, he devoured her stealthily with his eyes, which,luckily, were round and hard like clouded marbles, and incapableof disclosing his sentiments. His pitying emotion at the marks oftime upon the face of that woman, the air of frailty and wearyfatigue that had settled upon the eyes and temples of the"Never-tired Senora" (as Don Pepe years ago used to call her withadmiration), touched him almost to tears. "Don't go yet. To-dayis all my own," Mrs. Gould urged, gently. "We are not back yetofficially. No one will come. It's only to-morrow that thewindows of the Casa Gould are to be lit up for a reception."The doctor dropped into a chair."Giving a tertulia?" he said, with a detached air."A simple greeting for all the kind friends who care to come.""And only to-morrow?""Yes. Charles would be tired out after a day at the mine, and soI----It would be good to have him to myself for one evening onour return to this house I love.  It has seen all my life.""Ah, yes!" snarled the doctor, suddenly. "Women count time fromthe marriage feast. Didn't you live a little before?""Yes; but what is there to remember? There were no cares."Mrs. Gould sighed. And as two friends, after a long separation,will revert to the most agitated period of their lives, theybegan to talk of the Sulaco Revolution.  It seemed strange toMrs. Gould that people who had taken part in it seemed to forgetits memory and its lesson."And yet," struck in the doctor, "we who played our part in ithad our reward. Don Pepe, though superannuated, still can sit ahorse. Barrios is drinking himself to death in jovial companyaway somewhere on his fundacion beyond the Bolson de Tonoro. Andthe heroic Father Roman--I imagine the old padre blowing upsystematically the San Tome mine, uttering a pious exclamation atevery bang, and taking handfuls of snuff between theexplosions--the heroic Padre Roman says that he is not afraid ofthe harm Holroyd's missionaries can do to his flock, as long ashe is alive."Mrs. Gould shuddered a little at the allusion to the destructionthat had come so near to the San Tome mine."Ah, but you, dear friend?""I did the work I was fit for.""You faced the most cruel dangers of all. Something more thandeath.""No, Mrs. Gould! Only death--by hanging. And I am rewarded beyondmy deserts."Noticing Mrs. Gould's gaze fixed upon him, he dropped his eyes."I've made my career--as you see," said the Inspector-General ofState Hospitals, taking up lightly the lapels of his superfineblack coat. The doctor's self-respect marked inwardly by thealmost complete disappearance from his dreams of Father Beronappeared visibly in what, by contrast with former carelessness,seemed an immoderate cult of personal appearance.  Carried outwithin severe limits of form and colour, and in perpetualfreshness, this change of apparel gave to Dr. Monygham an air atthe same time professional and festive; while his gait and theunchanged crabbed character of his face acquired from it astartling force of incongruity."Yes," he went on. "We all had our rewards--theengineer-in-chief, Captain Mitchell----""We saw him," interrupted Mrs. Gould, in her charming voice. "Thepoor dear man came up from the country on purpose to call on usin our hotel in London. He comported himself with great dignity,but I fancy he regrets Sulaco. He rambled feebly about'historical events' till I felt I could have a cry.""H'm," grunted the doctor; "getting old, I suppose.  EvenNostromo is getting older--though he is not changed. And,speaking of that fellow, I wanted to tell you something----"For some time the house had been full of murmurs, of agitation.Suddenly the two gardeners, busy with rose trees at the side ofthe garden arch, fell upon their knees with bowed heads on thepassage of Antonia Avellanos, who appeared walking beside heruncle.Invested with the red hat after a short visit to Rome, where hehad been invited by the Propaganda, Father Corbelan, missionaryto the wild Indians, conspirator, friend and patron of Hernandezthe robber, advanced with big, slow strides, gaunt and leaningforward, with his powerful hands clasped behind his back. Thefirst Cardinal-Archbishop of Sulaco had preserved his fanaticaland morose air; the aspect of a chaplain of bandits.  It wasbelieved that his unexpected elevation to the purple was acounter-move to the Protestant invasion of Sulaco organized bythe Holroyd Missionary Fund.  Antonia, the beauty of her face asif a little blurred, her figure slightly fuller, advanced withher light walk and her high serenity, smiling from a distance atMrs.  Gould. She had brought her uncle over to see dear Emilia,without ceremony, just for a moment before the siesta.When all were seated again, Dr. Monygham, who had come to dislikeheartily everybody who approached Mrs. Gould with any intimacy,kept aside, pretending to be lost in profound meditation. Alouder phrase of Antonia made him lift his head."How can we abandon, groaning under oppression, those who havebeen our countrymen only a few years ago, who are our countrymennow?" Miss Avellanos was saying.  "How can we remain blind, anddeaf without pity to the cruel wrongs suffered by our brothers?There is a remedy.""Annex the rest of Costaguana to the order and prosperity ofSulaco," snapped the doctor. "There is no other remedy.""I am convinced, senor doctor," Antonia said, with the earnestcalm of invincible resolution, "that this was from the first poorMartin's intention.""Yes, but the material interests will not let you jeopardizetheir development for a mere idea of pity and justice," thedoctor muttered grumpily. "And it is just as well perhaps."The Cardinal-Archbishop straightened up his gaunt, bony frame."We have worked for them; we have made them, these materialinterests of the foreigners," the last of the Corbelans utteredin a deep, denunciatory tone."And without them you are nothing," cried the doctor from thedistance. "They will not let you.""Let them beware, then, lest the people, prevented from theiraspirations, should rise and claim their share of the wealth andtheir share of the power," the popular Cardinal-Archbishop ofSulaco declared, significantly, menacingly.A silence ensued, during which his Eminence stared, frowning atthe ground, and Antonia, graceful and rigid in her chair,breathed calmly in the strength of her convictions.  Then theconversation took a social turn, touching on the visit of theGoulds to Europe. The Cardinal-Archbishop, when in Rome, hadsuffered from neuralgia in the head all the time. It was theclimate--the bad air.When uncle and niece had gone away, with the servants againfalling on their knees, and the old porter, who had known HenryGould, almost totally blind and impotent now, creeping up to kisshis Eminence's extended hand, Dr. Monygham, looking after them,pronounced the one word--"Incorrigible!"Mrs. Gould, with a look upwards, dropped wearily on her lap herwhite hands flashing with the gold and stones of many rings."Conspiring. Yes!" said the doctor. "The last of the Avellanosand the last of the Corbelans are conspiring with the refugeesfrom Sta. Marta that flock here after every revolution. The CafeLambroso at the corner of the Plaza is full of them; you can heartheir chatter across the street like the noise of a parrothouse.They are conspiring for the invasion of Costaguana.  And do youknow where they go for strength, for the necessary force? To thesecret societies amongst immigrants and natives, whereNostromo--I should say Captain Fidanza--is the great man. Whatgives him that position? Who can say? Genius? He has genius. Heis greater with the populace than ever he was before. It is as ifhe had some secret power; some mysterious means to keep up hisinfluence. He holds conferences with the Archbishop, as in thoseold days which you and I remember. Barrios is useless.  But for amilitary head they have the pious Hernandez.  And they may raisethe country with the new cry of the wealth for the people.""Will there be never any peace? Will there be no rest?" Mrs.Gould whispered. "I thought that we----""No!" interrupted the doctor. "There is no peace and no rest inthe development of material interests.  They have their law, andtheir justice. But it is founded on expediency, and is inhuman;it is without rectitude, without the continuity and the forcethat can be found only in a moral principle. Mrs. Gould, the timeapproaches when all that the Gould Concession stands for shallweigh as heavily upon the people as the barbarism, cruelty, andmisrule of a few years back.""How can you say that, Dr. Monygham?" she cried out, as if hurtin the most sensitive place of her soul."I can say what is true," the doctor insisted, obstinately."It'll weigh as heavily, and provoke resentment, bloodshed, andvengeance, because the men have grown different. Do you thinkthat now the mine would march upon the town to save their SenorAdministrador?  Do you think that?"She pressed the backs of her entwined hands on her eyes andmurmured hopelessly--"Is it this we have worked for, then?"The doctor lowered his head. He could follow her silent thought.Was it for this that her life had been robbed of all the intimatefelicities of daily affection which her tenderness needed as thehuman body needs air to breathe? And the doctor, indignant withCharles Gould's blindness, hastened to change the conversation."It is about Nostromo that I wanted to talk to you.  Ah! thatfellow has some continuity and force. Nothing will put an end tohim. But never mind that.  There's something inexplicable goingon--or perhaps only too easy to explain. You know, Linda ispractically the lighthouse keeper of the Great Isabel light.  TheGaribaldino is too old now. His part is to clean the lamps and tocook in the house; but he can't get up the stairs any longer. Theblack-eyed Linda sleeps all day and watches the light all night.Not all day, though. She is up towards five in the afternoon,when our Nostromo, whenever he is in harbour with his schooner,comes out on his courting visit, pulling in a small boat.""Aren't they married yet?" Mrs. Gould asked.  "The mother wishedit, as far as I can understand, while Linda was yet quite achild. When I had the girls with me for a year or so during theWar of Separation, that extraordinary Linda used to declare quitesimply that she was going to be Gian' Battista's wife.""They are not married yet," said the doctor, curtly.  "I havelooked after them a little.""Thank you, dear Dr. Monygham," said Mrs.  Gould; and under theshade of the big trees her little, even teeth gleamed in ayouthful smile of gentle malice.  "People don't know how reallygood you are. You will not let them know, as if on purpose toannoy me, who have put my faith in your good heart long ago."The doctor, with a lifting up of his upper lip, as though he werelonging to bite, bowed stiffly in his chair.  With the utterabsorption of a man to whom love comes late, not as the mostsplendid of illusions, but like an enlightening and pricelessmisfortune, the sight of that woman (of whom he had been deprivedfor nearly a year) suggested ideas of adoration, of kissing thehem of her robe. And this excess of feeling translated itselfnaturally into an augmented grimness of speech."I am afraid of being overwhelmed by too much gratitude. However,these people interest me. I went out several times to the GreatIsabel light to look after old Giorgio."He did not tell Mrs. Gould that it was because he found there, inher absence, the relief of an atmosphere of congenial sentimentin old Giorgio's austere admiration for the "English signora--thebenefactress"; in black-eyed Linda's voluble, torrential,passionate affection for "our Dona Emilia--that angel"; in thewhite-throated, fair Giselle's adoring upward turn of the eyes,which then glided towards him with a sidelong, half-arch,half-candid glance, which made the doctor exclaim to himselfmentally, "If I weren't what I am, old and ugly, I would thinkthe minx is making eyes at me. And perhaps she is. I dare say shewould make eyes at anybody." Dr. Monygham said nothing of this toMrs. Gould, the providence of the Viola family, but reverted towhat he called "our great Nostromo.""What I wanted to tell you is this: Our great Nostromo did nottake much notice of the old man and the children for some years.It's true, too, that he was away on his coasting voyagescertainly ten months out of the twelve. He was making hisfortune, as he told Captain Mitchell once. He seems to have doneuncommonly well. It was only to be expected. He is a man full ofresource, full of confidence in himself, ready to take chancesand risks of every sort. I remember being in Mitchell's officeone day, when he came in with that calm, grave air he alwayscarries everywhere. He had been away trading in the Gulf ofCalifornia, he said, looking straight past us at the wall, as hismanner is, and was glad to see on his return that a lighthousewas being built on the cliff of the Great Isabel. Very glad, herepeated. Mitchell explained that it was the O. S. N. Co. who wasbuilding it, for the convenience of the mail service, on his ownadvice. Captain Fidanza was good enough to say that it wasexcellent advice. I remember him twisting up his moustaches andlooking all round the cornice of the room before he proposed thatold Giorgio should be made the keeper of that light.""I heard of this. I was consulted at the time," Mrs.  Gould said."I doubted whether it would be good for these girls to be shut upon that island as if in a prison.""The proposal fell in with the old Garibaldino's humour. As toLinda, any place was lovely and delightful enough for her as longas it was Nostromo's suggestion.  She could wait for her Gian'Battista's good pleasure there as well as anywhere else. Myopinion is that she was always in love with that incorruptibleCapataz. Moreover, both father and sister were anxious to getGiselle away from the attentions of a certain Ramirez.""Ah!" said Mrs. Gould, interested. "Ramirez?  What sort of man isthat?""Just a mozo of the town. His father was a Cargador.  As a lankyboy he ran about the wharf in rags, till Nostromo took him up andmade a man of him.  When he got a little older, he put him into alighter and very soon gave him charge of the No. 3 boat--the boatwhich took the silver away, Mrs. Gould. Nostromo selected thatlighter for the work because she was the best sailing and thestrongest boat of all the Company's fleet. Young Ramirez was oneof the five Cargadores entrusted with the removal of the treasurefrom the Custom House on that famous night. As the boat he hadcharge of was sunk, Nostromo, on leaving the Company's service,recommended him to Captain Mitchell for his successor. He hadtrained him in the routine of work perfectly, and thus Mr.Ramirez, from a starving waif, becomes a man and the Capataz ofthe Sulaco Cargadores.""Thanks to Nostromo," said Mrs. Gould, with warm approval."Thanks to Nostromo," repeated Dr. Monygham.  "Upon my word, thefellow's power frightens me when I think of it. That our poor oldMitchell was only too glad to appoint somebody trained to thework, who saved him trouble, is not surprising. What is wonderfulis the fact that the Sulaco Cargadores accepted Ramirez for theirchief, simply because such was Nostromo's good pleasure. Ofcourse, he is not a second Nostromo, as he fondly imagined hewould be; but still, the position was brilliant enough. Itemboldened him to make up to Giselle Viola, who, you know, is therecognized beauty of the town. The old Garibaldino, however, tooka violent dislike to him. I don't know why. Perhaps because hewas not a model of perfection like his Gian' Battista, theincarnation of the courage, the fidelity, the honour of 'thepeople.' Signor Viola does not think much of Sulaco natives. Bothof them, the old Spartan and that white-faced Linda, with her redmouth and coal-black eyes, were looking rather fiercely after thefair one. Ramirez was warned off. Father Viola, I am told,threatened him with his gun once.""But what of Giselle herself?" asked Mrs. Gould."She's a bit of a flirt, I believe," said the doctor. "I don'tthink she cared much one way or another. Of course she likesmen's attentions. Ramirez was not the only one, let me tell you,Mrs. Gould. There was one engineer, at least, on the railwaystaff who got warned off with a gun, too. Old Viola does notallow any trifling with his honour. He has grown uneasy andsuspicious since his wife died. He was very pleased to remove hisyoungest girl away from the town. But look what happens, Mrs.Gould. Ramirez, the honest, lovelorn swain, is forbidden theisland. Very well.  He respects the prohibition, but naturallyturns his eyes frequently towards the Great Isabel. It seems asthough he had been in the habit of gazing late at night upon thelight. And during these sentimental vigils he discovers thatNostromo, Captain Fidanza that is, returns very late from hisvisits to the Violas. As late as midnight at times."The doctor paused and stared meaningly at Mrs.  Gould."Yes. But I don't understand," she began, looking puzzled."Now comes the strange part," went on Dr. Monygham.  "Viola, whois king on his island, will allow no visitor on it after dark.Even Captain Fidanza has got to leave after sunset, when Lindahas gone up to tend the light. And Nostromo goes away obediently.But what happens afterwards? What does he do in the gulf betweenhalf-past six and midnight? He has been seen more than once atthat late hour pulling quietly into the harbour. Ramirez isdevoured by jealousy.  He dared not approach old Viola; but heplucked up courage to rail at Linda about it on Sunday morning asshe came on the mainland to hear mass and visit her mother'sgrave. There was a scene on the wharf, which, as a matter offact, I witnessed. It was early morning.  He must have beenwaiting for her on purpose. I was there by the merest chance,having been called to an urgent consultation by the doctor of theGerman gunboat in the harbour. She poured wrath, scorn, and flameupon Ramirez, who seemed out of his mind. It was a strange sight,Mrs. Gould: the long jetty, with this raving Cargador in hiscrimson sash and the girl all in black, at the end; the earlySunday morning quiet of the harbour in the shade of themountains; nothing but a canoe or two moving between the ships atanchor, and the German gunboat's gig coming to take me off. Lindapassed me within a foot. I noticed her wild eyes. I called out toher. She never heard me. She never saw me. But I looked at herface. It was awful in its anger and wretchedness."Mrs. Gould sat up, opening her eyes very wide."What do you mean, Dr. Monygham? Do you mean to say that yoususpect the younger sister?""Quien sabe! Who can tell?" said the doctor, shrugging hisshoulders like a born Costaguanero.  "Ramirez came up to me onthe wharf. He reeled--he looked insane. He took his head into hishands. He had to talk to someone--simply had to. Of course forall his mad state he recognized me. People know me well here. Ihave lived too long amongst them to be anything else but theevil-eyed doctor, who can cure all the ills of the flesh, andbring bad luck by a glance.  He came up to me. He tried to becalm. He tried to make it out that he wanted merely to warn meagainst Nostromo. It seems that Captain Fidanza at some secretmeeting or other had mentioned me as the worst despiser of allthe poor--of the people. It's very possible. He honours me withhis undying dislike.  And a word from the great Fidanza may bequite enough to send some fool's knife into my back. The SanitaryCommission I preside over is not in favour with the populace.'Beware of him, senor doctor. Destroy him, senor doctor,' Ramirezhissed right into my face.  And then he broke out. 'That man,' hespluttered, 'has cast a spell upon both these girls.' As tohimself, he had said too much. He must run away now--run away andhide somewhere. He moaned tenderly about Giselle, and then calledher names that cannot be repeated.  If he thought she could bemade to love him by any means, he would carry her off from theisland.  Off into the woods. But it was no good. . . . He strodeaway, flourishing his arms above his head. Then I noticed an oldnegro, who had been sitting behind a pile of cases, fishing fromthe wharf. He wound up his lines and slunk away at once. But hemust have heard something, and must have talked, too, becausesome of the old Garibaldino's railway friends, I suppose, warnedhim against Ramirez. At any rate, the father has been warned. ButRamirez has disappeared from the town.""I feel I have a duty towards these girls," said Mrs.  Gould,uneasily. "Is Nostromo in Sulaco now?""He is, since last Sunday.""He ought to be spoken to--at once.""Who will dare speak to him? Even the love-mad Ramirez runs awayfrom the mere shadow of Captain Fidanza.""I can. I will," Mrs. Gould declared. "A word will be enough fora man like Nostromo."The doctor smiled sourly."He must end this situation which lends itself to----I can'tbelieve it of that child," pursued Mrs. Gould."He's very attractive," muttered the doctor, gloomily."He'll see it, I am sure. He must put an end to all this bymarrying Linda at once," pronounced the first lady of Sulaco withimmense decision.Through the garden gate emerged Basilio, grown fat and sleek,with an elderly hairless face, wrinkles at the corners of hiseyes, and his jet-black, coarse hair plastered down smoothly.Stooping carefully behind an ornamental clump of bushes, he putdown with precaution a small child he had been carrying on hisshoulder--his own and Leonarda's last born. The pouting, spoiledCamerista and the head mozo of the Casa Gould had been marriedfor some years now.He remained squatting on his heels for a time, gazing fondly athis offspring, which returned his stare with imperturbablegravity; then, solemn and respectable, walked down the path."What is it, Basilio?" asked Mrs. Gould."A telephone came through from the office of the mine. The masterremains to sleep at the mountain to-night."Dr. Monygham had got up and stood looking away.  A profoundsilence reigned for a time under the shade of the biggest treesin the lovely gardens of the Casa Gould."Very well, Basilio," said Mrs. Gould. She watched him walk awayalong the path, step aside behind the flowering bush, andreappear with the child seated on his shoulder. He passed throughthe gateway between the garden and the patio with measured steps,careful of his light burden.The doctor, with his back to Mrs. Gould, contemplated aflower-bed away in the sunshine. People believed him scornful andsoured. The truth of his nature consisted in his capacity forpassion and in the sensitiveness of his temperament. What helacked was the polished callousness of men of the world, thecallousness from which springs an easy tolerance for oneself andothers; the tolerance wide as poles asunder from true sympathyand human compassion. This want of callousness accounted for hissardonic turn of mind and his biting speeches.In profound silence, and glaring viciously at the brilliantflower-bed, Dr. Monygham poured mental imprecations on CharlesGould's head. Behind him the immobility of Mrs. Gould added tothe grace of her seated figure the charm of art, of an attitudecaught and interpreted for ever. Turning abruptly, the doctortook his leave.Mrs. Gould leaned back in the shade of the big trees planted in acircle. She leaned back with her eyes closed and her white handslying idle on the arms of her seat. The half-light under thethick mass of leaves brought out the youthful prettiness of herface; made the clear, light fabrics and white lace of her dressappear luminous. Small and dainty, as if radiating a light of herown in the deep shade of the interlaced boughs, she resembled agood fairy, weary with a long career of well-doing, touched bythe withering suspicion of the uselessness of her labours, thepowerlessness of her magic.Had anybody asked her of what she was thinking, alone in thegarden of the Casa, with her husband at the mine and the houseclosed to the street like an empty dwelling, her frankness wouldhave had to evade the question. It had come into her mind thatfor life to be large and full, it must contain the care of thepast and of the future in every passing moment of the present.Our daily work must be done to the glory of the dead, and for thegood of those who come after. She thought that, and sighedwithout opening her eyes--without moving at all. Mrs. Gould'sface became set and rigid for a second, as if to receive, withoutflinching, a great wave of loneliness that swept over her head.And it came into her mind, too, that no one would ever ask herwith solicitude what she was thinking of. No one.  No one, butperhaps the man who had just gone away.  No; no one who could beanswered with careless sincerity in the ideal perfection ofconfidence.The word "incorrigible"--a word lately pronounced by Dr.Monygham--floated into her still and sad immobility.Incorrigible in his devotion to the great silver mine was theSenor Administrador! Incorrigible in his hard, determined serviceof the material interests to which he had pinned his faith in thetriumph of order and justice. Poor boy! She had a clear vision ofthe grey hairs on his temples. He was perfect--perfect.  Whatmore could she have expected? It was a colossal and lastingsuccess; and love was only a short moment of forgetfulness, ashort intoxication, whose delight one remembered with a sense ofsadness, as if it had been a deep grief lived through. There wassomething inherent in the necessities of successful action whichcarried with it the moral degradation of the idea.  She saw theSan Tome mountain hanging over the Campo, over the whole land,feared, hated, wealthy; more soulless than any tyrant, morepitiless and autocratic than the worst Government; ready to crushinnumerable lives in the expansion of its greatness.  He did notsee it. He could not see it. It was not his fault. He wasperfect, perfect; but she would never have him to herself. Never;not for one short hour altogether to herself in this old Spanishhouse she loved so well! Incorrigible, the last of the Corbelans,the last of the Avellanos, the doctor had said; but she sawclearly the San Tome mine possessing, consuming, burning up thelife of the last of the Costaguana Goulds; mastering theenergetic spirit of the son as it had mastered the lamentableweakness of the father. A terrible success for the last of theGoulds. The last! She had hoped for a long, long time, thatperhaps----But no!  There were to be no more. An immensedesolation, the dread of her own continued life, descended uponthe first lady of Sulaco. With a prophetic vision she saw herselfsurviving alone the degradation of her young ideal of life, oflove, of work--all alone in the Treasure House of the World. Theprofound, blind, suffering expression of a painful dream settledon her face with its closed eyes. In the indistinct voice of anunlucky sleeper.  lying passive in the grip of a mercilessnightmare, she stammered out aimlessly the words--"Material interest."CHAPTER TWELVENOSTROMO had been growing rich very slowly. It was an effect ofhis prudence. He could command himself even when thrown off hisbalance. And to become the slave of a treasure with fullself-knowledge is an occurrence rare and mentally disturbing. Butit was also in a great part because of the difficulty ofconverting it into a form in which it could become available. Themere act of getting it away from the island piecemeal, little bylittle, was surrounded by difficulties, by the dangers ofimminent detection. He had to visit the Great Isabel in secret,between his voyages along the coast, which were the ostensiblesource of his fortune.  The crew of his own schooner were to befeared as if they had been spies upon their dreaded captain. Hedid not dare stay too long in port. When his coaster wasunloaded, he hurried away on another trip, for he feared arousingsuspicion even by a day's delay.  Sometimes during a week's stay,or more, he could only manage one visit to the treasure. And thatwas all. A couple of ingots. He suffered through his fears asmuch as through his prudence. To do things by stealth humiliatedhim. And he suffered most from the concentration of his thoughtupon the treasure.A transgression, a crime, entering a man's existence, eats it uplike a malignant growth, consumes it like a fever. Nostromo hadlost his peace; the genuineness of all his qualities wasdestroyed. He felt it himself, and often cursed the silver of SanTome. His courage, his magnificence, his leisure, his work,everything was as before, only everything was a sham. But thetreasure was real. He clung to it with a more tenacious, mentalgrip. But he hated the feel of the ingots.  Sometimes, afterputting away a couple of them in his cabin--the fruit of a secretnight expedition to the Great Isabel--he would look fixedly athis fingers, as if surprised they had left no stain on his skin.He had found means of disposing of the silver bars in distantports. The necessity to go far afield made his coasting voyageslong, and caused his visits to the Viola household to be rare andfar between. He was fated to have his wife from there. He hadsaid so once to Giorgio himself. But the Garibaldino had put thesubject aside with a majestic wave of his hand, clutching asmouldering black briar-root pipe. There was plenty of time; hewas not the man to force his girls upon anybody.As time went on, Nostromo discovered his preference for theyounger of the two. They had some profound similarities ofnature, which must exist for complete confidence andunderstanding, no matter what outward differences of temperamentthere may be to exercise their own fascination of contrast. Hiswife would have to know his secret or else life would beimpossible.  He was attracted by Giselle, with her candid gazeand white throat, pliable, silent, fond of excitement under herquiet indolence; whereas Linda, with her intense, passionatelypale face, energetic, all fire and words, touched with gloom andscorn, a chip of the old block, true daughter of the austererepublican, but with Teresa's voice, inspired him with adeep-seated mistrust.  Moreover, the poor girl could not concealher love for Gian' Battista. He could see it would be violent,exacting, suspicious, uncompromising--like her soul.  Giselle, byher fair but warm beauty, by the surface placidity of her natureholding a promise of submissiveness, by the charm of her girlishmysteriousness, excited his passion and allayed his fears as tothe future.His absences from Sulaco were long. On returning from the longestof them, he made out lighters loaded with blocks of stone lyingunder the cliff of the Great Isabel; cranes and scaffoldingabove; workmen's figures moving about, and a small lighthousealready rising from its foundations on the edge of the cliff.At this unexpected, undreamt-of, startling sight, he thoughthimself lost irretrievably. What could save him from detectionnow? Nothing! He was struck with amazed dread at this turn ofchance, that would kindle a far-reaching light upon the onlysecret spot of his life; that life whose very essence, value,reality, consisted in its reflection from the admiring eyes ofmen. All of it but that thing which was beyond commoncomprehension; which stood between him and the power that hearsand gives effect to the evil intention of curses. It was dark.Not every man had such a darkness. And they were going to put alight there. A light! He saw it shining upon disgrace, poverty,contempt. Somebody was sure to. . . .  Perhaps somebody hadalready. . . .The incomparable Nostromo, the Capataz, the respected and fearedCaptain Fidanza, the unquestioned patron of secret societies, arepublican like old Giorgio, and a revolutionist at heart (but inanother manner), was on the point of jumping overboard from thedeck of his own schooner. That man, subjective almost toinsanity, looked suicide deliberately in the face. But he neverlost his head. He was checked by the thought that this was noescape. He imagined himself dead, and the disgrace, the shamegoing on. Or, rather, properly speaking, he could not imaginehimself dead. He was possessed too strongly by the sense of hisown existence, a thing of infinite duration in its changes, tograsp the notion of finality. The earth goes on for ever.And he was courageous. It was a corrupt courage, but it was asgood for his purposes as the other kind.  He sailed close to thecliff of the Great Isabel, throwing a penetrating glance from thedeck at the mouth of the ravine, tangled in an undisturbed growthof bushes.  He sailed close enough to exchange hails with theworkmen, shading their eyes on the edge of the sheer drop of thecliff overhung by the jib-head of a powerful crane.  He perceivedthat none of them had any occasion even to approach the ravinewhere the silver lay hidden; let alone to enter it. In theharbour he learned that no one slept on the island. The labouringgangs returned to port every evening, singing chorus songs in theempty lighters towed by a harbour tug. For the moment he hadnothing to fear.But afterwards? he asked himself. Later, when a keeper came tolive in the cottage that was being built some hundred and fiftyyards back from the low lighttower, and four hundred or so fromthe dark, shaded, jungly ravine, containing the secret of hissafety, of his influence, of his magnificence, of his power overthe future, of his defiance of ill-luck, of every possiblebetrayal from rich and poor alike--what then? He could nevershake off the treasure. His audacity, greater than that of othermen, had welded that vein of silver into his life. And thefeeling of fearful and ardent subjection, the feeling of hisslavery--so irremediable and profound that often, in histhoughts, he compared himself to the legendary Gringos, neitherdead nor alive, bound down to their conquest of unlawful wealthon Azuera--weighed heavily on the independent Captain Fidanza,owner and master of a coasting schooner, whose smart appearance(and fabulous good-luck in trading) were so well known along thewestern seaboard of a vast continent.Fiercely whiskered and grave, a shade less supple in his walk,the vigour and symmetry of his powerful limbs lost in thevulgarity of a brown tweed suit, made by Jews in the slums ofLondon, and sold by the clothing department of the CompaniaAnzani, Captain Fidanza was seen in the streets of Sulacoattending to his business, as usual, that trip. And, as usual, heallowed it to get about that he had made a great profit on hiscargo. It was a cargo of salt fish, and Lent was approaching. Hewas seen in tramcars going to and fro between the town and theharbour; he talked with people in a cafe or two in his measured,steady voice.  Captain Fidanza was seen. The generation thatwould know nothing of the famous ride to Cayta was not born yet.Nostromo, the miscalled Capataz de Cargadores, had made forhimself, under his rightful name, another public existence, butmodified by the new conditions, less picturesque, more difficultto keep up in the increased size and varied population of Sulaco,the progressive capital of the Occidental Republic.Captain Fidanza, unpicturesque, but always a little mysterious,was recognized quite sufficiently under the lofty glass and ironroof of the Sulaco railway station.  He took a local train, andgot out in Rincon, where he visited the widow of the Cargador whohad died of his wounds (at the dawn of the New Era, like Don JoseAvellanos) in the patio of the Casa Gould. He consented to sitdown and drink a glass of cool lemonade in the hut, while thewoman, standing up, poured a perfect torrent of words to which hedid not listen.  He left some money with her, as usual. Theorphaned children, growing up and well schooled, calling himuncle, clamoured for his blessing. He gave that, too; and in thedoorway paused for a moment to look at the flat face of the SanTome mountain with a faint frown.  This slight contraction of hisbronzed brow casting a marked tinge of severity upon his usualunbending expression, was observed at the Lodge which he attended--but went away before the banquet. He wore it at the meeting ofsome good comrades, Italians and Occidentals, assembled in hishonour under the presidency of an indigent, sickly, somewhathunchbacked little photographer, with a white face and amagnanimous soul dyed crimson by a bloodthirsty hate of allcapitalists, oppressors of the two hemispheres. The heroicGiorgio Viola, old revolutionist, would have understood nothingof his opening speech; and Captain Fidanza, lavishly generous asusual to some poor comrades, made no speech at all. He hadlistened, frowning, with his mind far away, and walked offunapproachable, silent, like a man full of cares.His frown deepened as, in the early morning, he watched thestone-masons go off to the Great Isabel, in lighters loaded withsquared blocks of stone, enough to add another course to thesquat light-tower. That was the rate of the work. One course perday.And Captain Fidanza meditated. The presence of strangers on theisland would cut him completely off the treasure. It had beendifficult and dangerous enough before. He was afraid, and he wasangry. He thought with the resolution of a master and the cunningof a cowed slave. Then he went ashore.He was a man of resource and ingenuity; and, as usual, theexpedient he found at a critical moment was effective enough toalter the situation radically. He had the gift of evolving safetyout of the very danger, this incomparable Nostromo, this "fellowin a thousand." With Giorgio established on the Great Isabel,there would be no need for concealment. He would be able to goopenly, in daylight, to see his daughters--one of hisdaughters--and stay late talking to the old Garibaldino. Then inthe dark . . . Night after night . . . He would dare to grow richquicker now. He yearned to clasp, embrace, absorb, subjugate inunquestioned possession this treasure, whose tyranny had weighedupon his mind, his actions, his very sleep.He went to see his friend Captain Mitchell--and the thing wasdone as Dr. Monygham had related to Mrs.  Gould. When the projectwas mooted to the Garibaldino, something like the faintreflection, the dim ghost of a very ancient smile, stole underthe white and enormous moustaches of the old hater of kings andministers.  His daughters were the object of his anxious care.The younger, especially. Linda, with her mother's voice, hadtaken more her mother's place. Her deep, vibrating "Eh, Padre?"seemed, but for the change of the word, the very echo of theimpassioned, remonstrating "Eh, Giorgio?" of poor Signora Teresa.It was his fixed opinion that the town was no proper place forhis girls. The infatuated but guileless Ramirez was the object ofhis profound aversion, as resuming the sins of the country whosepeople were blind, vile esclavos.On his return from his next voyage, Captain Fidanza found theViolas settled in the light-keeper's cottage.  His knowledge ofGiorgio's idiosyncrasies had not played him false. TheGaribaldino had refused to entertain the idea of any companionwhatever, except his girls. And Captain Mitchell, anxious toplease his poor Nostromo, with that felicity of inspiration whichonly true affection can give, had formally appointed Linda Violaas under-keeper of the Isabel's Light."The light is private property," he used to explain.  "It belongsto my Company. I've the power to nominate whom I like, and Violait shall be. It's about the only thing Nostromo--a man worth hisweight in gold, mind you--has ever asked me to do for him."Directly his schooner was anchored opposite the New Custom House,with its sham air of a Greek temple, flatroofed, with acolonnade, Captain Fidanza went pulling his small boat out of theharbour, bound for the Great Isabel, openly in the light of adeclining day, before all men's eyes, with a sense of havingmastered the fates. He must establish a regular position. Hewould ask him for his daughter now. He thought of Giselle as hepulled. Linda loved him, perhaps, but the old man would be gladto keep the elder, who had his wife's voice.He did not pull for the narrow strand where he had landed withDecoud, and afterwards alone on his first visit to the treasure.He made for the beach at the other end, and walked up the regularand gentle slope of the wedge-shaped island. Giorgio Viola, whomhe saw from afar, sitting on a bench under the front wall of thecottage, lifted his arm slightly to his loud hail.  He walked up.Neither of the girls appeared."It is good here," said the old man, in his austere, far-awaymanner.Nostromo nodded; then, after a short silence--"You saw my schooner pass in not two hours ago?  Do you know whyI am here before, so to speak, my anchor has fairly bitten intothe ground of this port of Sulaco?""You are welcome like a son," the old man declared, quietly,staring away upon the sea."Ah! thy son. I know. I am what thy son would have been. It iswell, viejo. It is a very good welcome.  Listen, I have come toask you for----"A sudden dread came upon the fearless and incorruptible Nostromo.He dared not utter the name in his mind. The slight pause onlyimparted a marked weight and solemnity to the changed end of thephrase."For my wife!" . . . His heart was beating fast." It is timeyou----"The Garibaldino arrested him with an extended arm.  "That wasleft for you to judge."He got up slowly. His beard, unclipped since Teresa's death,thick, snow-white, covered his powerful chest. He turned his headto the door, and called out in his strong voice--"Linda."Her answer came sharp and faint from within; and the appalledNostromo stood up, too, but remained mute, gazing at the door. Hewas afraid. He was not afraid of being refused the girl heloved--no mere refusal could stand between him and a woman hedesired--but the shining spectre of the treasure rose before him,claiming his allegiance in a silence that could not be gainsaid.He was afraid, because, neither dead nor alive, like the Gringoson Azuera, he belonged body and soul to the unlawfulness of hisaudacity. He was afraid of being forbidden the island. He wasafraid, and said nothing.Seeing the two men standing up side by side to await her, Lindastopped in the doorway. Nothing could alter the passionate deadwhiteness of her face; but her black eyes seemed to catch andconcentrate all the light of the low sun in a flaming sparkwithin the black depths, covered at once by the slow descent ofheavy eyelids."Behold thy husband, master, and benefactor." Old Viola's voiceresounded with a force that seemed to fill the whole gulf.She stepped forward with her eyes nearly closed, like asleep-walker in a beatific dream.Nostromo made a superhuman effort. "It is time, Linda, we twowere betrothed," he said, steadily, in his level, careless,unbending tone.She put her hand into his offered palm, lowering her head, darkwith bronze glints, upon which her father's hand rested for amoment."And so the soul of the dead is satisfied."This came from Giorgio Viola, who went on talking for a while ofhis dead wife; while the two, sitting side by side, never lookedat each other. Then the old man ceased; and Linda, motionless,began to speak."Ever since I felt I lived in the world, I have lived for youalone, Gian' Battista. And that you knew!  You knew it . . .Battistino."She pronounced the name exactly with her mother's intonation. Agloom as of the grave covered Nostromo's heart."Yes. I knew," he said.The heroic Garibaldino sat on the same bench bowing his hoaryhead, his old soul dwelling alone with its memories, tender andviolent, terrible and dreary--solitary on the earth full of men.And Linda, his best-loved daughter, was saying, "I was yours eversince I can remember. I had only to think of you for the earth tobecome empty to my eyes.  When you were there, I could see no oneelse. I was yours. Nothing is changed. The world belongs to you,and you let me live in it." . . . She dropped her low, vibratingvoice to a still lower note, and found other things tosay--torturing for the man at her side.  Her murmur ran on ardentand voluble. She did not seem to see her sister, who came outwith an altar-cloth she was embroidering in her hands, and passedin front of them, silent, fresh, fair, with a quick glance and afaint smile, to sit a little away on the other side of Nostromo.The evening was still. The sun sank almost to the edge of apurple ocean; and the white lighthouse, livid against thebackground of clouds filling the head of the gulf, bore thelantern red and glowing, like a live ember kindled by the fire ofthe sky. Giselle, indolent and demure, raised the altar-clothfrom time to time to hide nervous yawns, as of a young panther.Suddenly Linda rushed at her sister, and seizing her head,covered her face with kisses. Nostromo's brain reeled. When sheleft her, as if stunned by the violent caresses, with her handslying in her lap, the slave of the treasure felt as if he couldshoot that woman. Old Giorgio lifted his leonine head."Where are you going, Linda?""To the light, padre mio.""Si, si--to your duty."He got up, too, looked after his eldest daughter; then, in a tonewhose festive note seemed the echo of a mood lost in the night ofages--"I am going in to cook something. Aha! Son! The old man knowswhere to find a bottle of wine, too."He turned to Giselle, with a change to austere tenderness."And you, little one, pray not to the God of priests and slaves,but to the God of orphans, of the oppressed, of the poor, oflittle children, to give thee a man like this one for a husband."His hand rested heavily for a moment on Nostromo's shoulder; thenhe went in. The hopeless slave of the San Tome silver felt atthese words the venomous fangs of jealousy biting deep into hisheart. He was appalled by the novelty of the experience, by itsforce, by its physical intimacy. A husband! A husband for her!And yet it was natural that Giselle should have a husband at sometime or other. He had never realized that before. In discoveringthat her beauty could belong to another he felt as though hecould kill this one of old Giorgio's daughters also. He mutteredmoodily--"They say you love Ramirez."She shook her head without looking at him. Coppery glints rippledto and fro on the wealth of her gold hair. Her smooth foreheadhad the soft, pure sheen of a priceless pearl in the splendour ofthe sunset, mingling the gloom of starry spaces, the purple ofthe sea, and the crimson of the sky in a magnificent stillness."No," she said, slowly. "I never loved him. I think I never . . .He loves me--perhaps."The seduction of her slow voice died out of the air, and herraised eyes remained fixed on nothing, as if indifferent andwithout thought."Ramirez told you he loved you?" asked Nostromo, restraininghimself."Ah! once--one evening . . .""The miserable . . . Ha!"He had jumped up as if stung by a gad-fly, and stood before hermute with anger."Misericordia Divina! You, too, Gian' Battista!  Poor wretch thatI am!" she lamented in ingenuous tones. "I told Linda, and shescolded--she scolded.  Am I to live blind, dumb, and deaf in thisworld? And she told father, who took down his gun and cleaned it.Poor Ramirez! Then you came, and she told you."He looked at her. He fastened his eyes upon the hollow of herwhite throat, which had the invincible charm of things young,palpitating, delicate, and alive.  Was this the child he hadknown? Was it possible?  It dawned upon him that in these lastyears he had really seen very little--nothing--of her.   Nothing.She had come into the world like a thing unknown.  She had comeupon him unawares. She was a danger.  A frightful danger. Theinstinctive mood of fierce determination that had never failedhim before the perils of this life added its steady force to theviolence of his passion. She, in a voice that recalled to him thesong of running water, the tinkling of a silver bell, continued--"And between you three you have brought me here into thiscaptivity to the sky and water. Nothing else.  Sky and water. Oh,Sanctissima Madre. My hair shall turn grey on this tediousisland. I could hate you, Gian' Battista!"He laughed loudly. Her voice enveloped him like a caress. Shebemoaned her fate, spreading unconsciously, like a flower itsperfume in the coolness of the evening, the indefinable seductionof her person. Was it her fault that nobody ever had admiredLinda? Even when they were little, going out with their mother toMass, she remembered that people took no notice of Linda, who wasfearless, and chose instead to frighten her, who was timid, withtheir attention. It was her hair like gold, she supposed.He broke out--"Your hair like gold, and your eyes like violets, and your lipslike the rose; your round arms, your white throat." . . .Imperturbable in the indolence of her pose, she blushed deeplyall over to the roots of her hair. She was not conceited. She wasno more self-conscious than a flower. But she was pleased. Andperhaps even a flower loves to hear itself praised. He glanceddown, and added, impetuously--"Your little feet!"Leaning back against the rough stone wall of the cottage, sheseemed to bask languidly in the warmth of the rosy flush. Onlyher lowered eyes glanced at her little feet."And so you are going at last to marry our Linda.  She isterrible. Ah! now she will understand better since you have toldher you love her. She will not be so fierce.""Chica!" said Nostromo, "I have not told her anything.""Then make haste. Come to-morrow. Come and tell her, so that Imay have some peace from her scolding and--perhaps--who knows . ..""Be allowed to listen to your Ramirez, eh? Is that it? You . . .""Mercy of God! How violent you are, Giovanni," she said,unmoved.   "Who is Ramirez .  .  .  Ramirez .  .  . Who is he?"she repeated, dreamily, in the dusk and gloom of the cloudedgulf, with a low red streak in the west like a hot bar of glowingiron laid across the entrance of a world sombre as a cavern,where the magnificent Capataz de Cargadores had hidden hisconquests of love and wealth."Listen, Giselle," he said, in measured tones; "I will tell noword of love to your sister. Do you want to know why?""Alas! I could not understand perhaps, Giovanni.  Father says youare not like other men; that no one had ever understood youproperly; that the rich will be surprised yet. . . . Oh! saintsin heaven! I am weary."She raised her embroidery to conceal the lower part of her face,then let it fall on her lap. The lantern was shaded on the landside, but slanting away from the dark column of the lighthousethey could see the long shaft of light, kindled by Linda, go outto strike the expiring glow in a horizon of purple and red.Giselle Viola, with her head resting against the wall of thehouse, her eyes half closed, and her little feet, in whitestockings and black slippers, crossed over each other, seemed tosurrender herself, tranquil and fatal, to the gathering dusk. Thecharm of her body, the promising mysteriousness of her indolence,went out into the night of the Placid Gulf like a fresh andintoxicating fragrance spreading out in the shadows, impregnatingthe air. The incorruptible Nostromo breathed her ambientseduction in the tumultuous heaving of his breast. Before leavingthe harbour he had thrown off the store clothing of CaptainFidanza, for greater ease in the long pull out to the islands. Hestood before her in the red sash and check shirt as he used toappear on the Company's wharf--a Mediterranean sailor come ashoreto try his luck in Costaguana.  The dusk of purple and redenveloped him, too--close, soft, profound, as no more than fiftyyards from that spot it had gathered evening after evening aboutthe self-destructive passion of Don Martin Decoud's utterscepticism, flaming up to death in solitude."You have got to hear," he began at last, with perfectself-control. "I shall say no word of love to your sister, towhom I am betrothed from this evening, because it is you that Ilove. It is you!" . . .The dusk let him see yet the tender and voluptuous smile thatcame instinctively upon her lips shaped for love and kisses,freeze hard in the drawn, haggard lines of terror. He could notrestrain himself any longer.  While she shrank from his approach,her arms went out to him, abandoned and regal in the dignity ofher languid surrender. He held her head in his two hands, andshowered rapid kisses upon the upturned face that gleamed in thepurple dusk. Masterful and tender, he was entering slowly uponthe fulness of his possession.  And he perceived that she wascrying. Then the incomparable Capataz, the man of careless loves,became gentle and caressing, like a woman to the grief of achild. He murmured to her fondly. He sat down by her and nursedher fair head on his breast. He called her his star and hislittle flower.It had grown dark. From the living-room of the light-keeper'scottage, where Giorgio, one of the Immortal Thousand, was bendinghis leonine and heroic head over a charcoal fire, there came thesound of sizzling and the aroma of an artistic frittura.In the obscure disarray of that thing, happening like acataclysm, it was in her feminine head that some gleam of reasonsurvived. He was lost to the world in their embraced stillness.But she said, whispering into his ear--"God of mercy! What will become of me--here--now--between thissky and this water I hate? Linda, Linda--I see her!" . . . Shetried to get out of his arms, suddenly relaxed at the sound ofthat name. But there was no one approaching their black shapes,enlaced and struggling on the white background of the wall."Linda! Poor Linda! I tremble! I shall die of fear before my poorsister Linda, betrothed to-day to Giovanni--my lover! Giovanni,you must have been mad! I cannot understand you! You are not likeother men! I will not give you up--never--only to God himself!But why have you done this blind, mad, cruel, frightful thing?"Released, she hung her head, let fall her hands. The altar-cloth,as if tossed by a great wind, lay far away from them, gleamingwhite on the black ground."From fear of losing my hope of you," said Nostromo."You knew that you had my soul! You know everything!  It was madefor you! But what could stand between you and me? What? Tell me!"she repeated, without impatience, in superb assurance."Your dead mother," he said, very low."Ah! . . . Poor mother! She has always . . .  She is a saint inheaven now, and I cannot give you up to her. No, Giovanni. Onlyto God alone. You were mad--but it is done. Oh! what have youdone?  Giovanni, my beloved, my life, my master, do not leave mehere in this grave of clouds. You cannot leave me now. You musttake me away--at once--this instant--in the little boat.Giovanni, carry me off to-night, from my fear of Linda's eyes,before I have to look at her again."She nestled close to him. The slave of the San Tome silver feltthe weight as of chains upon his limbs, a pressure as of a coldhand upon his lips. He struggled against the spell."I cannot," he said. "Not yet. There is something that standsbetween us two and the freedom of the world."She pressed her form closer to his side with a subtle and naiveinstinct of seduction."You rave, Giovanni--my lover!" she whispered, engagingly. "Whatcan there be? Carry me off--in thy very hands--to DonaEmilia--away from here.  I am not very heavy."It seemed as though she expected him to lift her up at once inhis two palms. She had lost the notion of all impossibility.Anything could happen on this night of wonder. As he made nomovement, she almost cried aloud--"I tell you I am afraid of Linda!" And still he did not move. Shebecame quiet and wily. "What can there be?" she asked, coaxingly.He felt her warm, breathing, alive, quivering in the hollow ofhis arm. In the exulting consciousness of his strength, and thetriumphant excitement of his mind, he struck out for his freedom."A treasure," he said. All was still. She did not understand. "Atreasure. A treasure of silver to buy a gold crown for thy brow.""A treasure?" she repeated in a faint voice, as if from thedepths of a dream. "What is it you say?"She disengaged herself gently. He got up and looked down at her,aware of her face, of her hair, her lips, the dimples on hercheeks--seeing the fascination of her person in the night of thegulf as if in the blaze of noonday.  Her nonchalant and seductivevoice trembled with the excitement of admiring awe andungovernable curiosity."A treasure of silver!" she stammered out. Then pressed onfaster: "What? Where? How did you get it, Giovanni?"He wrestled with the spell of captivity. It was as if striking aheroic blow that he burst out--"Like a thief!"The densest blackness of the Placid Gulf seemed to fall upon hishead. He could not see her now. She had vanished into a long,obscure abysmal silence, whence her voice came back to him aftera time with a faint glimmer, which was her face."I love you! I love you!"These words gave him an unwonted sense of freedom; they cast aspell stronger than the accursed spell of the treasure; theychanged his weary subjection to that dead thing into an exultingconviction of his power.  He would cherish her, he said, in asplendour as great as Dona Emilia's. The rich lived on wealthstolen from the people, but he had taken from the rich nothing--nothing that was not lost to them already by their folly andtheir betrayal. For he had been betrayed--he said--deceived,tempted. She believed him. . . .  He had kept the treasure forpurposes of revenge; but now he cared nothing for it. He caredonly for her.  He would put her beauty in a palace on a hillcrowned with olive trees--a white palace above a blue sea. Hewould keep her there like a jewel in a casket. He would get landfor her--her own land fertile with vines and corn--to set herlittle feet upon. He kissed them. . . .  He had already paid forit all with the soul of a woman and the life of a man. . . . TheCapataz de Cargadores tasted the supreme intoxication of hisgenerosity.  He flung the mastered treasure superbly at her feetin the impenetrable darkness of the gulf, in the darknessdefying--as men said--the knowledge of God and the wit of thedevil. But she must let him grow rich first--he warned her.She listened as if in a trance. Her fingers stirred in his hair.He got up from his knees reeling, weak, empty, as though he hadflung his soul away."Make haste, then," she said. "Make haste, Giovanni, my lover, mymaster, for I will give thee up to no one but God. And I amafraid of Linda."He guessed at her shudder, and swore to do his best.  He trustedthe courage of her love. She promised to be brave in order to beloved always--far away in a white palace upon a hill above a bluesea. Then with a timid, tentative eagerness she murmured--"Where is it? Where? Tell me that, Giovanni."He opened his mouth and remained silent--thunderstruck."Not that! Not that!" he gasped out, appalled at the spell ofsecrecy that had kept him dumb before so many people falling uponhis lips again with unimpaired force. Not even to her. Not evento her. It was too dangerous. "I forbid thee to ask," he cried ather, deadening cautiously the anger of his voice.He had not regained his freedom. The spectre of the unlawfultreasure arose, standing by her side like a figure of silver,pitiless and secret, with a finger on its pale lips.  His souldied within him at the vision of himself creeping in presentlyalong the ravine, with the smell of earth, of damp foliage in hisnostrils--creeping in, determined in a purpose that numbed hisbreast, and creeping out again loaded with silver, with his earsalert to every sound. It must be done on this very night--thatwork of a craven slave!He stooped low, pressed the hem of her skirt to his lips, with amuttered command--"Tell him I would not stay," and was gone suddenly from her,silent, without as much as a footfall in the dark night.She sat still, her head resting indolently against the wall, andher little feet in white stockings and black slippers crossedover each other. Old Giorgio, coming out, did not seem to besurprised at the intelligence as much as she had vaguely feared.For she was full of inexplicable fear now--fear of everything andeverybody except of her Giovanni and his treasure. But that wasincredible.The heroic Garibaldino accepted Nostromo's abrupt departure witha sagacious indulgence. He remembered his own feelings, andexhibited a masculine penetration of the true state of the case."Va bene. Let him go. Ha! ha! No matter how fair the woman, itgalls a little. Liberty, liberty.  There's more than one kind! Hehas said the great word, and son Gian' Battista is not tame." Heseemed to be instructing the motionless and scared Giselle.  . .. "A man should not be tame," he added, dogmatically out of thedoorway. Her stillness and silence seemed to displease him. "Donot give way to the enviousness of your sister's lot," headmonished her, very grave, in his deep voice.Presently he had to come to the door again to call in his youngerdaughter. It was late. He shouted her name three times before sheeven moved her head. Left alone, she had become the helpless preyof astonishment.  She walked into the bedroom she shared withLinda like a person profoundly asleep. That aspect was so markedthat even old Giorgio, spectacled, raising his eyes from theBible, shook his head as she shut the door behind her.She walked right across the room without looking at anything, andsat down at once by the open window.  Linda, stealing down fromthe tower in the exuberance of her happiness, found her with alighted candle at her back, facing the black night full ofsighing gusts of wind and the sound of distant showers--a truenight of the gulf, too dense for the eye of God and the wiles ofthe devil. She did not turn her head at the opening of the door.There was something in that immobility which reached Linda in thedepths of her paradise. The elder sister guessed angrily: thechild is thinking of that wretched Ramirez. Linda longed to talk.She said in her arbitrary voice, "Giselle!" and was not answeredby the slightest movement.The girl that was going to live in a palace and walk on ground ofher own was ready to die with terror. Not for anything in theworld would she have turned her head to face her sister. Herheart was beating madly.  She said with subdued haste--"Do not speak to me. I am praying."Linda, disappointed, went out quietly; and Giselle sat onunbelieving, lost, dazed, patient, as if waiting for theconfirmation of the incredible. The hopeless blackness of theclouds seemed part of a dream, too. She waited.She did not wait in vain. The man whose soul was dead within him,creeping out of the ravine, weighted with silver, had seen thegleam of the lighted window, and could not help retracing hissteps from the beach.On that impenetrable background, obliterating the lofty mountainsby the seaboard, she saw the slave of the San Tome silver, as ifby an extraordinary power of a miracle. She accepted his returnas if henceforth the world could hold no surprise for alleternity.She rose, compelled and rigid, and began to speak long before thelight from within fell upon the face of the approaching man."You have come back to carry me off. It is well! Open thy arms,Giovanni, my lover. I am coming."His prudent footsteps stopped, and with his eyes glisteningwildly, he spoke in a harsh voice:"Not yet. I must grow rich slowly." . . . A threatening note cameinto his tone. "Do not forget that you have a thief for yourlover.""Yes! Yes!" she whispered, hastily. "Come nearer!  Listen! Do notgive me up, Giovanni! Never, never! . . . I will be patient! . . ."Her form drooped consolingly over the low casement towards theslave of the unlawful treasure. The light in the room went out,and weighted with silver, the magnificent Capataz clasped herround her white neck in the darkness of the gulf as a drowningman clutches at a straw.CHAPTER THIRTEENON THE day Mrs. Gould was going, in Dr. Monygham's words, to"give a tertulia," Captain Fidanza went down the side of hisschooner lying in Sulaco harbour, calm, unbending, deliberate inthe way he sat down in his dinghy and took up his sculls. He waslater than usual. The afternoon was well advanced before helanded on the beach of the Great Isabel, and with a steady paceclimbed the slope of the island.From a distance he made out Giselle sitting in a chair tiltedback against the end of the house, under the window of the girl'sroom. She had her embroidery in her hands, and held it well up toher eyes. The tranquillity of that girlish figure exasperated thefeeling of perpetual struggle and strife he carried in hisbreast. He became angry. It seemed to him that she ought to hearthe clanking of his fetters--his silver fetters, from afar.  Andwhile ashore that day, he had met the doctor with the evil eye,who had looked at him very hard.The raising of her eyes mollified him. They smiled in theirflower-like freshness straight upon his heart. Then she frowned.It was a warning to be cautious. He stopped some distance away,and in a loud, indifferent tone, said--"Good day, Giselle. Is Linda up yet?""Yes. She is in the big room with father."He approached then, and, looking through the window into thebedroom for fear of being detected by Linda returning there forsome reason, he said, moving only his lips--"You love me?""More than my life." She went on with her embroidery under hiscontemplating gaze and continued to speak, looking at her work,"Or I could not live. I could not, Giovanni. For this life islike death. Oh, Giovanni, I shall perish if you do not take meaway."He smiled carelessly. "I will come to the window when it's dark,"he said."No, don't, Giovanni. Not-to-night. Linda and father have beentalking together for a long time today.""What about?""Ramirez, I fancy I heard. I do not know. I am afraid. I amalways afraid. It is like dying a thousand times a day. Your loveis to me like your treasure to you. It is there, but I can neverget enough of it."He looked at her very still. She was beautiful. His desire hadgrown within him. He had two masters now. But she was incapableof sustained emotion.  She was sincere in what she said, but sheslept placidly at night. When she saw him she flamed up always.Then only an increased taciturnity marked the change in her. Shewas afraid of betraying herself. She was afraid of pain, ofbodily harm, of sharp words, of facing anger, and witnessingviolence. For her soul was light and tender with a pagansincerity in its impulses. She murmured--"Give up the palazzo, Giovanni, and the vineyard on the hills,for which we are starving our love."She ceased, seeing Linda standing silent at the corner of thehouse.Nostromo turned to his affianced wife with a greeting, and wasamazed at her sunken eyes, at her hollow cheeks, at the air ofillness and anguish in her face."Have you been ill?" he asked, trying to put some concern intothis question.Her black eyes blazed at him. "Am I thinner?" she asked."Yes--perhaps--a little.""And older?""Every day counts--for all of us.""I shall go grey, I fear, before the ring is on my finger," shesaid, slowly, keeping her gaze fastened upon him.She waited for what he would say, rolling down her turned-upsleeves."No fear of that," he said, absently.She turned away as if it had been something final, and busiedherself with household cares while Nostromo talked with herfather. Conversation with the old Garibaldino was not easy. Agehad left his faculties unimpaired, only they seemed to havewithdrawn somewhere deep within him. His answers were slow incoming, with an effect of august gravity. But that day he wasmore animated, quicker; there seemed to be more life in the oldlion. He was uneasy for the integrity of his honour. He believedSidoni's warning as to Ramirez's designs upon his youngerdaughter. And he did not trust her. She was flighty. He saidnothing of his cares to "Son Gian' Battista." It was a touch ofsenile vanity. He wanted to show that he was equal yet to thetask of guarding alone the honour of his house.Nostromo went away early. As soon as he had disappeared, walkingtowards the beach, Linda stepped over the threshold and, with ahaggard smile, sat down by the side of her father.Ever since that Sunday, when the infatuated and desperate Ramirezhad waited for her on the wharf, she had no doubts whatever. Thejealous ravings of that man were no revelation. They had onlyfixed with precision, as with a nail driven into her heart, thatsense of unreality and deception which, instead of bliss andsecurity, she had found in her intercourse with her promisedhusband. She had passed on, pouring indignation and scorn uponRamirez; but, that Sunday, she nearly died of wretchedness andshame, lying on the carved and lettered stone of Teresa's grave,subscribed for by the engine-drivers and the fitters of therailway workshops, in sign of their respect for the hero ofItalian Unity. Old Viola had not been able to carry out hisdesire of burying his wife in the sea; and Linda wept upon thestone.The gratuitous outrage appalled her. If he wished to break herheart--well and good. Everything was permitted to Gian' Battista.But why trample upon the pieces; why seek to humiliate herspirit? Aha! He could not break that. She dried her tears. AndGiselle! Giselle! The little one that, ever since she couldtoddle, had always clung to her skirt for protection.  Whatduplicity! But she could not help it probably. When there was aman in the case the poor featherheaded wretch could not helpherself.Linda had a good share of the Viola stoicism. She resolved to saynothing. But woman-like she put passion into her stoicism.Giselle's short answers, prompted by fearful caution, drove herbeside herself by their curtness that resembled disdain. One dayshe flung herself upon the chair in which her indolent sister waslying and impressed the mark of her teeth at the base of thewhitest neck in Sulaco. Giselle cried out. But she had her shareof the Viola heroism. Ready to faint with terror, she only said,in a lazy voice, "Madre de Dios! Are you going to eat me alive,Linda?" And this outburst passed off leaving no trace upon thesituation.  "She knows nothing. She cannot know any thing,"reflected Giselle. "Perhaps it is not true.  It cannot be true,"Linda tried to persuade herself.But when she saw Captain Fidanza for the first time after hermeeting with the distracted Ramirez, the certitude of hermisfortune returned. She watched him from the doorway go away tohis boat, asking herself stoically, "Will they meet to-night?"She made up her mind not to leave the tower for a second. When hehad disappeared she came out and sat down by her father.The venerable Garibaldino felt, in his own words, "a young manyet." In one way or another a good deal of talk about Ramirez hadreached him of late; and his contempt and dislike of that man whoobviously was not what his son would have been, had made himrestless.  He slept very little now; but for several nights pastinstead of reading--or only sitting, with Mrs.  Gould's silverspectacles on his nose, before the open Bible, he had beenprowling actively all about the island with his old gun, on watchover his honour.Linda, laying her thin brown hand on his knee, tried to soothehis excitement. Ramirez was not in Sulaco.  Nobody knew where hewas. He was gone. His talk of what he would do meant nothing."No," the old man interrupted. "But son Gian' Battista toldme--quite of himself--that the cowardly esclavo was drinking andgambling with the rascals of Zapiga, over there on the north sideof the gulf. He may get some of the worst scoundrels of thatscoundrelly town of negroes to help him in his attempt upon thelittle one. . . . But I am not so old. No!"She argued earnestly against the probability of any attempt beingmade; and at last the old man fell silent, chewing his whitemoustache.  Women had their obstinate notions which must behumoured--his poor wife was like that, and Linda resembled hermother. It was not seemly for a man to argue. "May be. May be,"he mumbled.She was by no means easy in her mind. She loved Nostromo. Sheturned her eyes upon Giselle, sitting at a distance, withsomething of maternal tenderness, and the jealous anguish of arival outraged in her defeat.  Then she rose and walked over toher."Listen--you," she said, roughly.The invincible candour of the gaze, raised up all violet and dew,excited her rage and admiration. She had beautiful eyes--theChica--this vile thing of white flesh and black deception. Shedid not know whether she wanted to tear them out with shouts ofvengeance or cover up their mysterious and shameless innocencewith kisses of pity and love. And suddenly they became empty,gazing blankly at her, except for a little fear not quite burieddeep enough with all the other emotions in Giselle's heart.Linda said, "Ramirez is boasting in town that he will carry youoff from the island.""What folly!" answered the other, and in a perversity born oflong restraint, she added: "He is not the man," in a jesting tonewith a trembling audacity."No?" said Linda, through her clenched teeth. "Is he not? Well,then, look to it; because father has been walking about with aloaded gun at night.""It is not good for him. You must tell him not to, Linda. He willnot listen to me.""I shall say nothing--never any more--to anybody," cried Linda,passionately.This could not last, thought Giselle. Giovanni must take her awaysoon--the very next time he came. She would not suffer theseterrors for ever so much silver.  To speak with her sister madeher ill. But she was not uneasy at her father's watchfulness. Shehad begged Nostromo not to come to the window that night. He hadpromised to keep away for this once. And she did not know, couldnot guess or imagine, that he had another reason for coming onthe island.Linda had gone straight to the tower. It was time to light up.She unlocked the little door, and went heavily up the spiralstaircase, carrying her love for the magnificent Capataz deCargadores like an ever-increasing load of shameful fetters. No;she could not throw it off.  No; let Heaven dispose of these two.And moving about the lantern, filled with twilight and the sheenof the moon, with careful movements she lighted the lamp.  Thenher arms fell along her body."And with our mother looking on," she murmured.  "My ownsister--the Chica!"The whole refracting apparatus, with its brass fittings and ringsof prisms, glittered and sparkled like a domeshaped shrine ofdiamonds, containing not a lamp, but some sacred flame,dominating the sea. And Linda, the keeper, in black, with a paleface, drooped low in a wooden chair, alone with her jealousy, farabove the shames and passions of the earth. A strange, draggingpain as if somebody were pulling her about brutally by her darkhair with bronze glints, made her put her hands up to hertemples. They would meet. They would meet. And she knew where,too. At the window.  The sweat of torture fell in drops on hercheeks, while the moonlight in the offing closed as if with acolossal bar of silver the entrance of the Placid Gulf--thesombre cavern of clouds and stillness in the surf-frettedseaboard.Linda Viola stood up suddenly with a finger on her lip.  He lovedneither her nor her sister. The whole thing seemed so objectlessas to frighten her, and also give her some hope. Why did he notcarry her off? What prevented him? He was incomprehensible. Whatwere they waiting for? For what end were these two lying anddeceiving? Not for the ends of their love. There was no suchthing. The hope of regaining him for herself made her break hervow of not leaving the tower that night. She must talk at once toher father, who was wise, and would understand. She ran down thespiral stairs. At the moment of opening the door at the bottomshe heard the sound of the first shot ever fired on the GreatIsabel.She felt a shock, as though the bullet had struck her breast. Sheran on without pausing. The cottage was dark. She cried at thedoor, "Giselle! Giselle!" then dashed round the corner andscreamed her sister's name at the open window, without getting ananswer; but as she was rushing, distracted, round the house,Giselle came out of the door, and darted past her, runningsilently, her hair loose, and her eyes staring straight ahead.She seemed to skim along the grass as if on tiptoe, and vanished.Linda walked on slowly, with her arms stretched out before her.All was still on the island; she did not know where she wasgoing. The tree under which Martin Decoud spent his last days,beholding life like a succession of senseless images, threw alarge blotch of black shade upon the grass. Suddenly she saw herfather, standing quietly all alone in the moonlight.The Garibaldino--big, erect, with his snow-white hair andbeard--had a monumental repose in his immobility, leaning upon arifle. She put her hand upon his arm lightly. He never stirred."What have you done?" she asked, in her ordinary voice."I have shot Ramirez--infame!" he answered, with his eyesdirected to where the shade was blackest.  "Like a thief he came,and like a thief he fell. The child had to be protected."He did not offer to move an inch, to advance a single step. Hestood there, rugged and unstirring, like a statue of an old manguarding the honour of his house.  Linda removed her tremblinghand from his arm, firm and steady like an arm of stone, and,without a word, entered the blackness of the shade. She saw astir of formless shapes on the ground, and stopped short. Amurmur of despair and tears grew louder to her strained hearing."I entreated you not to come to-night. Oh, my Giovanni! And youpromised. Oh! Why--why did you come, Giovanni?"It was her sister's voice. It broke on a heartrending sob. Andthe voice of the resourceful Capataz de Cargadores, master andslave of the San Tome treasure, who had been caught unawares byold Giorgio while stealing across the open towards the ravine toget some more silver, answered careless and cool, but soundingstartlingly weak from the ground."It seemed as though I could not live through the night withoutseeing thee once more--my star, my little flower."*         *         *         *         *The brilliant tertulia was just over, the last guests haddeparted, and the Senor Administrador had gone to his roomalready, when Dr. Monygham, who had been expected in the eveningbut had not turned up, arrived driving along the wood-blockpavement under the electric-lamps of the deserted Calle de laConstitucion, and found the great gateway of the Casa still open.He limped in, stumped up the stairs, and found the fat and sleekBasilio on the point of turning off the lights in the sala. Theprosperous majordomo remained open-mouthed at this late invasion."Don't put out the lights," commanded the doctor.  "I want to seethe senora.""The senora is in the Senor Adminstrador's cancillaria," saidBasilio, in an unctuous voice. "The Senor Administrador startsfor the mountain in an hour.  There is some trouble with theworkmen to be feared, it appears. A shameless people withoutreason and decency.  And idle, senor. Idle.""You are shamelessly lazy and imbecile yourself," said thedoctor, with that faculty for exasperation which made him sogenerally beloved. "Don't put the lights out."Basilio retired with dignity. Dr. Monygham, waiting in thebrilliantly lighted sala, heard presently a door close at thefurther end of the house. A jingle of spurs died out. The SenorAdministrador was off to the mountain.With a measured swish of her long train, flashing with jewels andthe shimmer of silk, her delicate head bowed as if under theweight of a mass of fair hair, in which the silver threads werelost, the "first lady of Sulaco," as Captain Mitchell used todescribe her, moved along the lighted corredor, wealthy beyondgreat dreams of wealth, considered, loved, respected, honoured,and as solitary as any human being had ever been, perhaps, onthis earth.The doctor's "Mrs. Gould! One minute!" stopped her with a startat the door of the lighted and empty sala. From the similarity ofmood and circumstance, the sight of the doctor, standing thereall alone amongst the groups of furniture, recalled to heremotional memory her unexpected meeting with Martin Decoud; sheseemed to hear in the silence the voice of that man, deadmiserably so many years ago, pronounce the words, "Antonia lefther fan here." But it was the doctor's voice that spoke, a littlealtered by his excitement.  She remarked his shining eyes."Mrs. Gould, you are wanted. Do you know what has happened? Youremember what I told you yesterday about Nostromo. Well, it seemsthat a lancha, a decked boat, coming from Zapiga, with fournegroes in her, passing close to the Great Isabel, was hailedfrom the cliff by a woman's voice--Linda's, as a matter offact--commanding them (it's a moonlight night) to go round to thebeach and take up a wounded man to the town. The patron (fromwhom I've heard all this), of course, did so at once. He told methat when they got round to the low side of the Great Isabel,they found Linda Viola waiting for them. They followed her: sheled them under a tree not far from the cottage.  There they foundNostromo lying on the ground with his head in the younger girl'slap, and father Viola standing some distance off leaning on hisgun. Under Linda's direction they got a table out of the cottagefor a stretcher, after breaking off the legs. They are here, Mrs.Gould. I mean Nostromo and--and Giselle.  The negroes brought himin to the first-aid hospital near the harbour. He made theattendant send for me. But it was not me he wanted to see--it wasyou, Mrs. Gould! It was you.""Me?" whispered Mrs. Gould, shrinking a little."Yes, you!" the doctor burst out. "He begged me--his enemy, ashe thinks--to bring you to him at once.  It seems he hassomething to say to you alone.""Impossible!" murmured Mrs. Gould."He said to me, 'Remind her that I have done something to keep aroof over her head.' . . . Mrs.  Gould," the doctor pursued, inthe greatest excitement.  "Do you remember the silver? The silverin the lighter--that was lost?"Mrs. Gould remembered. But she did not say she hated the meremention of that silver. Frankness personified, she rememberedwith an exaggerated horror that for the first and last time ofher life she had concealed the truth from her husband about thatvery silver. She had been corrupted by her fears at that time,and she had never forgiven herself. Moreover, that silver, whichwould never have come down if her husband had been madeacquainted with the news brought by Decoud, had been in aroundabout way nearly the cause of Dr. Monygham's death. Andthese things appeared to her very dreadful."Was it lost, though?" the doctor exclaimed. "I've always feltthat there was a mystery about our Nostromo ever since. I dobelieve he wants now, at the point of death----""The point of death?" repeated Mrs. Gould."Yes. Yes. . . . He wants perhaps to tell you somethingconcerning that silver which----""Oh, no! No!" exclaimed Mrs. Gould, in a low voice. "Isn't itlost and done with? Isn't there enough treasure without it tomake everybody in the world miserable?"The doctor remained still, in a submissive, disappointed silence.At last he ventured, very low--"And there is that Viola girl, Giselle. What are we to do? Itlooks as though father and sister had----"Mrs. Gould admitted that she felt in duty bound to do her bestfor these girls."I have a volante here," the doctor said. "If you don't mindgetting into that----"He waited, all impatience, till Mrs. Gould reappeared, havingthrown over her dress a grey cloak with a deep hood.It was thus that, cloaked and monastically hooded over herevening costume, this woman, full of endurance and compassion,stood by the side of the bed on which the splendid Capataz deCargadores lay stretched out motionless on his back. Thewhiteness of sheets and pillows gave a sombre and energeticrelief to his bronzed.  face, to the dark, nervous hands, so goodon a tiller, upon a bridle and on a trigger, lying open and idleupon a white coverlet."She is innocent," the Capataz was saying in a deep and levelvoice, as though afraid that a louder word would break theslender hold his spirit still kept upon his body. "She isinnocent. It is I alone. But no matter. For these things I wouldanswer to no man or woman alive."He paused. Mrs. Gould's face, very white within the shadow of thehood, bent over him with an invincible and dreary sadness. Andthe low sobs of Giselle Viola, kneeling at the end of the bed,her gold hair with coppery gleams loose and scattered over theCapataz's feet, hardly troubled the silence of the room."Ha! Old Giorgio--the guardian of thine honour!  Fancy theVecchio coming upon me so light of foot, so steady of aim. Imyself could have done no better.  But the price of a charge ofpowder might have been saved. The honour was safe. . . . Senora,she would have followed to the end of the world Nostromo thethief. . . . I have said the word. The spell is broken!"A low moan from the girl made him cast his eyes down."I cannot see her. . . . No matter," he went on, with the shadowof the old magnificent carelessness in his voice. "One kiss isenough, if there is no time for more. An airy soul, senora!Bright and warm, like sunshine--soon clouded, and soon serene.They would crush it there between them. Senora, cast on her theeye of your compassion, as famed from one end of the land to theother as the courage and daring of the man who speaks to you. Shewill console herself in time.  And even Ramirez is not a badfellow. I am not angry.  No! It is not Ramirez who overcame theCapataz of the Sulaco Cargadores." He paused, made an effort, andin louder voice, a little wildly, declared--"I die betrayed--betrayed by----"But he did not say by whom or by what he was dying betrayed."She would not have betrayed me," he began again, opening hiseyes very wide. "She was faithful. We were going very far--verysoon. I could have torn myself away from that accursed treasurefor her. For that child I would have left boxes and boxes ofit--full.  And Decoud took four. Four ingots. Why? Picardia!  Tobetray me? How could I give back the treasure with four ingotsmissing? They would have said I had purloined them. The doctorwould have said that.  Alas! it holds me yet!"Mrs. Gould bent low, fascinated--cold with apprehension."What became of Don Martin on that night, Nostromo?""Who knows? I wondered what would become of me. Now I know. Deathwas to come upon me unawares.  He went away! He betrayed me. Andyou think I have killed him! You are all alike, you fine people.The silver has killed me. It has held me. It holds me yet. Nobodyknows where it is. But you are the wife of Don Carlos, who put itinto my hands and said, 'Save it on your life.' And when Ireturned, and you all thought it was lost, what do I hear? 'Itwas nothing of importance. Let it go. Up, Nostromo, the faithful,and ride away to save us, for dear life!'""Nostromo!" Mrs. Gould whispered, bending very low. "I, too, havehated the idea of that silver from the bottom of my heart.""Marvellous!--that one of you should hate the wealth that youknow so well how to take from the hands of the poor. The worldrests upon the poor, as old Giorgio says. You have been alwaysgood to the poor. But there is something accursed in wealth.Senora, shall I tell you where the treasure is? To you alone. . .. Shining! Incorruptible!"A pained, involuntary reluctance lingered in his tone, in hiseyes, plain to the woman with the genius of sympatheticintuition. She averted her glance from the miserable subjectionof the dying man, appalled, wishing to hear no more of thesilver."No, Capataz," she said. "No one misses it now.  Let it be lostfor ever."After hearing these words, Nostromo closed his eyes, uttered noword, made no movement. Outside the door of the sick-room Dr.Monygham, excited to the highest pitch, his eyes shining witheagerness, came up to the two women."Now, Mrs. Gould," he said, almost brutally in his impatience,"tell me, was I right? There is a mystery.  You have got the wordof it, have you not? He told you----""He told me nothing," said Mrs. Gould, steadily.The light of his temperamental enmity to Nostromo went out of Dr.Monygham's eyes. He stepped back submissively. He did not believeMrs. Gould. But her word was law. He accepted her denial like aninexplicable fatality affirming the victory of Nostromo's geniusover his own. Even before that woman, whom he loved with secretdevotion, he had been defeated by the magnificent Capataz deCargadores, the man who had lived his own life on the assumptionof unbroken fidelity, rectitude, and courage!"Pray send at once somebody for my carriage," spoke Mrs. Gouldfrom within her hood. Then, turning to Giselle Viola, "Comenearer me, child; come closer. We will wait here."Giselle Viola, heartbroken and childlike, her face veiled in herfalling hair, crept up to her side. Mrs.  Gould slipped her handthrough the arm of the unworthy daughter of old Viola, theimmaculate republican, the hero without a stain. Slowly,gradually, as a withered flower droops, the head of the girl, whowould have followed a thief to the end of the world
